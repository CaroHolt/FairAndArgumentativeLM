       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nIt is not a privilege to drink in this country. A privilege is something that is given to someone who deserves it. Alcohol is not by any means something deserved but a drink like any other that all should be allowed at the age of 18 to consume. Why you may say... Well, at 18 years old if I am allowed to drive on my own, kill someone and go to jail for life, then why wouldn't I be able to sip a glass of wine? Compared to all of these other things, it really isn't that serious of a thing to allow people to drink.  \\n  \\r\\nSomething to point out would be that by prohibiting those who are 18 to drink, you are creating more of an issue in this country. People who are between 18 and 21 consume more alcohol then people who are 21 and above. This nature that they are forbidden to do so causes them to retaliate and drink more just in secret. In foreign countries like France, England, Spain, etc. the legal age of drinking is 18 and compared to America, they have less problems with drinking then America does. If we lowered the drinking age it would gradually decrease the amount of consumption by these 18-21 year olds because instead of going out on a thursday night and getting \"wasted,\" they can just simply have a glass or two every now and then.  \\n  \\r\\nRegarding the bill of rights, it is an outdated document altogether and should be revamped to include alcohol and other important rights like gay marriage. If they would go over and edit the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Constitution every 8 years as it was proposed, then it would better fit today's modern issues in society. Currently, as it stands, the Constitution itself sets the basis for our laws. It too discusses alcohol as being a right because the Constitution as a whole defines our rights. It may not be a natural right that we have at birth, however, it is a right that we do have.  \\n  \\r\\nBy changing it to 18 also, it will help reduce the number of deaths in this country each year that we have in drunk driving amongst teens because if they are allowed to drink then they won't be as reckless about it and they don't have to over indulge alcohol whenever they come into contact with it at parties and clubs since they don't know when they will get the chance to get some more.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nOkay, thank you for responding.  \\r\\nI have two very important points to make.  \\r\\nLet's take a look at the Bible, shall we? In the Bible, it states quite clearly in Leviticus 20:13 of the King Jame's Bible:  \\r\\nIf a man also lie with mankind, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.  \\r\\nNotice something? It's an abomination, not a sin. Now, dictionary.com defines an abomination as \"anything abominable; anything greatly disliked or abhorred.\" It also defines sin as \"any reprehensible or regrettable action, behavior, lapse, etc.; great fault or offense.\" Those are different definitions.  \\r\\nNow, let's search through the Bible to see some other abominations:  \\r\\nDeuteronomy: A marriage is not valid if a women is not a virgin, and she shall be executed if she is not.  \\r\\nMark: Divorce is not allowed.  \\r\\nOther rules:  \\r\\nNot having a round haircut  \\r\\nNot having a tattoo  \\r\\nNot associating with a women on her period.  \\r\\nworking on the Sabbath  \\r\\nwearing something of mixed fabrics  \\r\\nNot eating shellfish  \\r\\nNot playing with the skin of a pig (football)  \\r\\nMost Christians I know do not follow any of these rules. So why do they not consider these things sins but being gay a sin? Answer me that, please.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\n     I hope it doesn't disappoint my opponent too greatly to know that I will be making arguments similar to the ones made in the case before with some additions in the structure of the case. While my opponent's case seems to be centered only on practicality, my case will surround both morality (as perceived by justice) and practicality in order to reach the optimum in the scope of the betterment of society.   Contention 1:   Denial of gay marriage creates second-class citizens.  The definition of second-class citizens is the following: \"an informal term used to describe a person who is systematically discriminated against within a state or other political jurisdiction, despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there. While not necessarily slaves, outlaws or criminals, second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and economic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their putative superiors.\" At the point where the government is limiting the rights of homosexuals when it comes to the marriage they can have, this is inherently discrimination by the state against a group of people, creating a set of second-class citizens. When a marriage is only allowed for a heterosexual couple rather than a homosexual couple, it implies that a heterosexual couple is  more in worth than a homosexual one. Homosexuals have a right for protection against this sort of discrimination through the principles of social contract.   Contention 2  : Gay marriage benefits society.   On a more practical level, the legalization of gay marriage can be beneficial for society:      Sub-point 2a:   The supplement to tolerance of the homosexual community as a result of legalization of gay marriage has helped to reduce negative statistics in the homosexual community.   The proven evidence shows us that the negative statistics in the homosexual community, ranging from the amounts of sexually-transmitted diseases shared among homosexual patrons to the drug and alcohol abuse and suicide rates, have all been shown to be caused as a result of intolerance against the homosexual community. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention writes on homophobia and AIDS rates: \" Stigma and homophobia may have a profound impact on the lives of MSM, especially their mental and sexual health. Internalized homophobia may impact men’s ability to make healthy choices, including decisions around sex and substance use. Stigma and homophobia may limit the willingness of MSM to access HIV prevention and care, isolate them from family and community support, and create cultural barriers that inhibit integration into social networks.\" In the Emory University study provided, the study confirms that denial of gay marriage is a form of intolerance, and with the passage of legislation denying same-sex marriage, AIDS rates among homosexuals will increase by 4 per 100,000 cases, while legalizing will reduce by 1 per 100,000 cases.  As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain, intolerance is greatly negative for the health of the gay community:   \"Negative attitudes about homosexuality can lead to rejection by friends and family, discriminatory acts and violence that harm specific individuals, and laws and policies that adversely affect the lives of many people; this can have damaging effects on the health of MSM and other sexual minorities. Homophobia, stigma and discrimination can:\\r\\n  \\n  Limit MSM's ability to access high quality health care that is responsive to health issues of MSM  \\n  Affect income, employment status, and the ability to get and keep health insurance  \\n  Contribute to poor mental health and unhealthy behaviors, such as substance abuse, risky sexual behaviors, and suicide attempts  \\n  Affect MSM's ability to establish and maintain long-term same-sex relationships that reduce HIV &amp; STD risk  \\n  Make it difficult for some MSM to be open about same-sex behaviors with others, which can increase stress, limit social support, and negatively affect health  \\n  \\n  The effects of homophobia, stigma and discrimination can be especially hard on adolescents and young adults. Young MSM and other sexual minorities are at increased risk of being bullied in school. They are also at risk of being rejected by their families and, as a result, are at increased risk of homelessness. A study published in 2009 compared gay, lesbian, and bisexual young adults who experienced strong rejection from their families with their peers who had more supportive families. The researchers found that those who experienced stronger rejection were:  \\n  \\n  8.4 times momore likely to report high levels of depression  \\n  3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs  \\n  3.4 times more likely to have risky sex  \\n  4.0 times more likely to commit suicide  \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  The very same report explains that social support is the key toward reducing the problems of homophobia in the country and hence reduce the problems that result from this.   \\n  \\n  \\n  Sub-point 2b:   Legalization of same-sex marriage has been beneficial to commerce.  The following evidence of economy after the passage of legalization of same-sex marriage shows us that the legalization is a great supplement to commerce because of the increase of demand for products.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  When looking through my opponent's case, it isn't so much a case as much as it is an iteration as to what the burdens of my case are. I need to explain why marriage should be recognized in the first place with reasoning that allows for gay couples to be able to enter, and when going through his case, there are several things wrong with the reasoning therein.  Reproduction:   One of the things that puzzled me about my opponent's logic is where he transitions between humans having the lack of ability to reproduce at an individual level and him proposing that government should condone a unit that would compensate for this. My opponent states himself that two individuals can come in at any time and commence in the act that leads toward reproduction, but he states that this is not a solution with absolutely no reason why. This entire blank area makes the entire thesis of his case shaky at best because his premise is that marriage should compensate for this lack of ability to reproduce, but there's no warrant explaining why this needs to be compensated.  Characteristics of Marriage/Gay Marriage/ Infertile Couples/People Who Don't have Sex:   I put this all into one big category because it's the reasoning jumbled together in all of these main points from my opponent's case that really highlights the contradictions in my opponent's case. To reiterate, my opponent's main thesis is that marriage should compensate for the individual's lack of ability to reproduce independently, and when he outlines the characteristics of his idealized marriage and what a gay marriage is, it's come to my understanding that my opponent is trying to prove that there is no warrant for accepting gay marriage. My opponent talks about the objections that there are with infertile couples and states that his argument does not require children in a marriage, but this would mean that his entire thesis would be useless because it's dedicated toward upholding the biological function that reproduces children. If this is true, then my opponent's entire premise for being against gay marriage and upholding only heterosexual marriage is irrelevant. Not only this, but he stated himself that one of the objectives for marriage in his scenario is to raise children, and if infertile couples cannot reach this objective in his conception of marriage, they also should not be recognized under this scenario. My opponent then moves away from the argument he makes when he starts talking about people who don't have sex. He explains what a real marriage is, and beforehand states that this is what the government should accept, but then turns around and says that marriage policy is aimed at trying to recognize AS CLOSE TO real marriages as possible, meaning he's contradicted his own logic. In my opponent's logic of what constitutes a real marriage, gay marriage is not a real marriage and should not be accepted for this reason, but he states that people who have marriage not intended toward raising children (again, I emphasize, one of his key points about what constitutes a real marriage) does not constitute a real marriage, but they can still be recognized in the eyes of the government. This is a complete double-standard because it allows a leniancy toward such marriages but denies them to gay couples. In fact, my opponent even said himself that there are exceptions, but he in no way designates what these exceptions are and why they do not apply to gay couples.  African Americans:   For now, this argument doesn't go against his logic in any way, and it doesn't go against anything I have in my case, so for now, I'll leave it be.   I'll move on to my case now.  R1:   When going back to my opponent's case, he himself clearly allows leniancy toward marriages that are only warranted by desire considering the contradictions in reasoning between his thesis and his justification for infertile couples and people who don't have sex, but he tries to knock down my arguments because I'm somehow trying to make an argument with the idea of a marriage based on desire. Furthermore, he states that homosexual couples are intrinsically worth less than heterosexual ones and possibly it is because they do not use their organs in the fashion that my opponent specified, but this would also mean that the infertile couples and couples practicing celibacy or safe sex would also be intrinsically worth less, but he allows leniancy for them despite the fact that their marriages also contradict his standards of what a real marriage is and what kind of marriage should be legalized. It's becoming more and more apparent that my opponent's entire case is just discriminating against homosexuals with a double-standard. My opponent talks about how the reasoning in my first contention would justify other second-class citizens. It actually MIGHT (except in the case of pedophiles, who actually harm children and intake in the immoral action of taking advantage of a child, meaning they are out of social contract). My opponent pretty much begs the question in this argument by not stating why this would be a bad thing.  R2:   I must've accidentally missed to put up my sources. My fault. I'll place those in the comment section before the end of this debate. My opponent also states that the Emory University study is biased but provides no reasoning as to why. If we look at history, we realize that governments beforehand have had to enforce certain moral views in order to maintain its legitimacy. From the American government's perspective, for example, the abolishment of slavery, which also had contrasting moral views. However, this is looking at a case from a practical level rather than a moral level. Social integretiy and welfare is among the responsibilities of government, and this includes the betterment of public health. At the point where my case proves that public health is benefitted, what government would be doing by allowing gay marriages is trying reach the objective of maintaining the social unit. From a moral level, both our cases inherently enforce a moral idea voluntarily or involuntarily. Denying gay marriage would also be forcing moral views about homosexual acts and legitimacy of gay relationships because this action would support the people against such relationships. At the point where both our cases could validate a moral viewpoint based on my opponent's logic and my opponent is trying to hit my case at a moral level, he would have to prove that the moral viewpoint he would be supporting with his own case is better than the moral viewpoint that I would be supporting.  R3  : Their money MIGHT be spent in other establishments or resources, but there's a big gray area as to how much of that money would be spent. The official measure of an economy is the GDP (or GDI, which is equal to the GDP) and it only measures the amount of goods bought in one year. Over a period of time, a gay couple might spend X amount of money, but the economy's GDP is only specific to one year. The fallacy that my opponent accuses me of only depends on the assumption that these couples have the incentive to spend within this given year. A legalization would provide that incentive to increase the spending within that given year.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  As I am arguing on the affirmative it would generally be agreed that I have the burden of proof. As such I will start my argument right away and reserve the last round for summary and conclusion, not adding any new arguments at that time.  I am afraid I must disagree with the second of Con's guidelines. While this is not a debate as to the existence of God, sin is not general malfeasance, it is specifically transgression of God's law or more broadly in my own Catholic faith anything that tends to separate man from God. Any discussion of sin must take into account this aspect, otherwise it would be a discussion of crime or immoral behavior generally and would not need to use such religious terms as \"sin\". Any argument about the social or personal effects of sin cannot avoid taking for granted the existence of God as the source of objective morality; the standard against which moral behavior must be judged. The premise itself takes sin for granted and simply seeks to surmise whether or not this has an effect on society. Let us start with some of the statements made by my partner in this debate and then move on to the premise I will be defending in this debate.  Sin has, from this religious standpoint an objective and subjective dimension. Something can be objectively sinful, and, due to ignorance, a person could not be culpable of engaging in that action. The person must be actively trying to correctly form his conscience, but the matter remains that those two dimensions exist. For mortal sin to exist in Catholic theology for instance there must be grave matter (something must be very wrong) full knowledge (the person must know this is wrong) and full consent of the will (I choose freely to do so anyways).  1. Humans do not commit \"sin\", but rather make mistakes and bad choices      The rationale given to support this assertion is that there is little or no evidence that homosexuality of converting from one religion to another is immoral. Were this true it would call into question whether or not homosexuality and converting to another faith are sins, not whether or not sin exists. In any case there is indeed a reason to consider both of these sins.  Homosexuality.   Sex is ordered towards the unitive and procreative capacities which lead to the formation of strong families and aid in raising healthy children. That is, sex draws a couple closer together in their commitment to one another and has the potential to create new life which this closely bound couple can then properly raise. To remove sexuality from this context goes against its true meaning and is therefore considered to be sinful. Homosexuality is such a case. You may disagree with it, you may argue with it, but it is not base assertion, but a reasoned position.  Apostasy  : Conversion in and of itself is not considered by any religion to be immoral. It is in fact considered to be the highest virtue when a person converts to the religion regarded as true. You call it conversion when someone changes to the true religion and apostasy when one changes from the true religion to a false one. This is also sinful in that it quite literally separates a person from the path revealed by God to draw people nearer to him, a sin against Truth. Once again, one may agree or disagree, but there is definitely reasoning behind it.  2. \"Judgmental\" God and society  The argument seems to be that people refrain from sinning because they are afraid of being judged by their peers or their God (in the first case facing ostracism and in the second eternal damnation). This may or may not be their true motivation, I cannot know. In any case it is irrelevant to the case at hand, which is whether or not it affects society.  Truth Matters  A society where people strive for truth and virtue is a better society. I do not mean that all men are virtuous in said society, or even that most men are virtuous; but if a determining number of that society actively seek out truth and attempt to live virtuously society will be better for it. Some people may be wrong about what constitutes sin and what doesn't, but this attempt to live virtuously (and at least avoiding sin in the subjective sense) will lead to a healthier society in that the person seeks the good of the community and his fellow man rather than his own good.  In the objective sense truth also matters. If it is true that homosexuality is a sin, then the promotion of that sin is contrary to the greater good of that society and this is detrimental to it. If it is true that homosexuality is not a sin, then to limit the expression of homosexuality or attempt to curtail what is billed as \"gay rights\" would be a sin and detrimental to society. Sin may be subjective in one sense, but truth does matter, and a society which does not turn its back on truth but lives according to it will be better off.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  Homosexual behavior and apostasy  As to my defense of the idea of   homosexual behavior and apostasy   as sins, I do not think it is actually important for our discussion to prove conclusively what particular acts constitute sins and which don't. For that we would have to take too specific a viewpoint. If looked upon from a Catholic perspective, for instance, contraception would be a sin; this is not the case from the perspective of most protestants or for Buddhist. The same goes for the eating of pork. Most religions are fine with this, Judaism and Islam, however, see it as something prohibited by God which it is a sin, therefore, to consume. What I will attempt to prove in this debate is that if sin is a valid concept its effects on society will always be detrimental.  I will, however, defend my definition of apostasy. The dictionary does not take the viewpoint of a particular faith, so they opted to describe apostasy as the leaving of a religion. However, as it is religions that define sin and not Oxford linguists, it would be enlightening to see what different religious groups define as apostasy. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines apostasy as \"the total repudiation of the Christian faith\" (1) Islam, however, defines it as the abandonment of ones previous faith by a Muslim (2). They disagree about the definition of apostasy simply because they disagree about which religion is true.  Con is quite right to mention the fact that there are many different religions who all make truth claims. This, however, is not entirely germane to our conversation. For my side of this debate to be considered upheld it is enough to prove that in principle sin is bad for society, it is not necessary for me to prove which religious viewpoint on the matter of sin is the correct one. Whichever is true, the very fact that it is the truth makes it of greatest value to society.  \"Judgmental\" God and society  I fail to see how this is relevant. You mention bullying, which is also a sin, causes higher rates of suicide. This may be the case, but the case of a sin (bullying) against a person for committing a sin (acting on homosexual tendencies) causing a sin (suicide) -or if we do not accept homosexual behavior as a sin then the yet more terrible case of a sin against an innocent person causing a sin- is simply the very best example of my position. Sin is terrible for society.  Truth Matters  I do not see how my statement contradicts my logic. I pointed out there are reasons behind the belief that homosexual behavior is sinful, and then I say that whether or not it actually is sinful is irrelevant to the matter of the effects of sin on society.   Con also mentions the statement that \"a society which does not turn its back on truth but lives according to it will be better off\" is ambiguous. Let's try to clear it up with an example. Let us say that my opponent is correct in saying homosexuality is not a sin. This would then be the truth. A society that accepts this as true, does not put undue pressure on innocent people for their sexual orientation and is generally accepting of homosexuality and homosexual persons would be a more just society than one which does not. On the contrary, if I am right and homosexuality causes harm to both the individuals and society, then it would be a mistake not to separate the necessary respect for individuals from the harmful promotion of an objective harm. In either case, the truth of the matter is of vital importance; were society to get it wrong it would create an objective injustice.  It is true that a sin is a \"bad choice\", it is also a bad choice to listen to Britney Spears when you have the option of listening to Jimi Hendrix, but it is not a sin. \"Bad choice\" is also connotatively negative (it has the word \"bad\" in it, you can't get more negative than saying outright something is bad), the difference is that sin is rightly seen as something far graver than having bad taste in music. We are speaking particularly of the terrible choice of turning your back -by word, action or omission- from the ultimate Good.

She says she’s back from out of town and asks if you’d like to get a drink on Saturday, and since you’ve never passed a stove you didn’t touch, plans are made. You meet at a bar. To your surprise, this time she shows up. You order a beer, start making small talk, seems like everything’s going well. You get up to pee, and when you get back, she’s ordered shots. She’s got a sly smirk on her face, a sly smirk you didn't make much of at the time, but that you'll remember until your dying day. You down the shot in one gulp and it tastes like sh!t.  \\n  “What is this?”   \\n  She responds, “G.”   \\n  You think she’s talking about gin, and you don't know better because you've never had gin before. Of course, she’s actually talking about GHB, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, commonly known as a date rape drug. A couple drinks later, the room is doing   Inception   things and you’re not sure what the fvck is going on. She takes you back to her place, semi-conscious, and once you’re alone, she forces more druggings down your lips. The whole night is a blur but you’ll never forget the moment she starts anally penetrating you – you’ve never done that before – and you’ve never felt so humiliated in your entire life. She knows what’s she’s doing, stimulates you in all the right places to get you hard, even though you want nothing more than for her to stop. Over the course of the night, you lose count of the times she rapes you. You’re sobbing and kicking and punching but you’re too weak to get her off you, and she doesn’t care – it’s all some sick roleplay in her mind.  \\n  When it ends, you think about going to the police. But you don't, because what if all your bros find out you were raped by some chick? You don’t think you can handle the humiliation, and you don't think the police will even believe you, and you hate yourself and your life, and you spend the next 5 years depressed, scared to have sex, getting panic attacks anytime you meet a girl in a bar, and constantly ideating suicide.   This debate is about trying to help men protect themselves from date rape. It's also a debate about sexism, because date rape protection tools are marketed towards women but not men, and that's a huge problem because male date rape is a very real thing.  I’m going to make two arguments. First, I’ll argue that the lack of date rape protection tools for men violates basic notions of fairness or justice. To make this argument, I’ll show that the lack of tools for men perpetuates (and is predicated on) sexist gender stereotypes. Second, I’ll argue that the lack of date rape protection tools for men is a net harm to society. Each argument affirms independently. The former affirms even if the lack of date rape protection tools is a net benefit to society, while the latter affirms even if the lack of tools is fair and just.  \\n  (1)  Male rape is more common than most poeple think. It's so common that the Justice Department recently updated its definition of rape to include men.   http://www.justice.gov...  The definition update was in response to a study by the Justice Department that found 1 in 33 men have experienced “a completed or attempted rape.”   https://www.ncjrs.gov...  Another study found that 12.9% of men are sexually assaulted at least once during their lifetime. This same study also found that male victims were 3.4 times more likely to be depressed and 2.4 times more likely to ideate suicide.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...  The male rape problem extends to date rape. Men are increasingly getting date raped. This is especially a problem in the gay community, which is known for its promiscuous hookup culture. Gay men are date raping other gay men, the same way the straight men date rape women. But the problem isn't limited to the gay community; men are getting date raped by women too.   Now, there's a few date rape protection tools on the market, but they're marketed exclusively (or at least almost exclusively) towards women. For example, one of the tools is a nail polish that changes colors when it comes into contact with date rape drugs. A girl can just put her finger in the drink to check it for drugs.  Developing and marketing date rape protection tools to women but not men is sexist. Marketing date rape protection tools exclusively to women sends a message that men aren't susceptible to date rape - and that messge is predicated on traditional (read: sexist) gender stereotypes. In this traditional worldview, men aren't victims of rape because women are smaller and weaker than me. Men aren't victims of rape because women aren't sexual in the same ways as men; they're not aggressors. The reality is differnet. Lots of men don't comply with these traditional gender roles. Lots of men are smaller/weaker than lots of women. Lots of men are feminine and lots of women are masculine.  The lack of date rape protection tools for men doesn't just discriminate against straight men who don't comply with traditional gender roles - it also discriminates against gay men. The entire gay community is excluded from the category of rape - they're treated like non-entities.  As such, marketing protection tools to women but not men is unfair to men and it's unjust - and it perpetuates sexist gender norms and contributes to homophobia.   (2)  The lack of date rape protection tools for men is also a net harm to society. This is because date rape protection tools will stop some rapes from happening. It will help some men protect themselves from date rape, both in a straight context and a gay context, and these men will benefit immensely by never being raped. It makes date rape harder to perpetrate.  What are the harms of marketing date rape protection tools to men? None. What are the benefits? Men get access to protection, which in turns lowers the rate of successful date rapes against men. The other benefit is that it sends a message to men that it's okay for them to be a victim of date rape - that it's not an affront to their masculinity. This will help men report date rape more, because they won't feel like it's something completely unaccepted by society. Sending a message that men can and are raped, and that men can and should seek help (i.e. from date rape protection tools, or from the police after a rape) is a massive benefit to men who are actually raped. These men won't get as depressed, they won't ideate suicide, and so on. Remember, men who are raped are more likely to be depressed and ideate suicide than women. Marketing date rape protection tools may lower that discrepancy by helping men get less depressed.  What are the harms of not marketing date rape protection tools to men? It communicates a message that men aren't ever victims of rape, which in turn contributes to the depression and suicide ideation experienced by men who are actually raped. It also means lots of men are gonna get date raped who might have prevented the date rape if they (a) knew male date rape was a thing, and (b) had bought protection tools to help them prevent date rape. What are the benefits of not marketing date rape protection tools to men? There are no benefits.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nI mostly accepted this debate because being transgender is definitely NOT a mental disease.  \\n  \\r\\nAs for the pronouns, I will call transgender people what they prefer and look like. If they are a guy to a girl, I'm going to call them \"she\". Same with the other way around. Whenever agender people get purposely offended when I mis-pronoun them and freak out about it, that's a different story. If someone kept on calling me \"she\" even though I'm a he, I would be annoyed at first but could accept it despite it being not true. If someone who calls themselves an agender individual demands that they be referred to as \"ze\" or \"zir\", that's just ridiculous. We don't need to add any more words to the English language because of how they feel.  \\n  \\r\\nI will be happy to talk about this further if you would like.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nI'm sorry. I meant to ask how gender is NOT different from sex. That is my mistake. If you can, please answer it in the comments.  \\n  \\r\\nMental disorder and/or Gender Dysphoria is a better term for transgenders and agender people. When you said \"mental disease\" and \"mental illness\", that was what caused me to act. It was mostly the \"disease\" part of it.  \\n  \\r\\nThanks for answering the question. For the most part, I'm the same way but am more lenient on what transgender people want to be called (as long as it's an ACTUAL English word unlike \"zir\" or something like that). I believe that transgender people can request that others call them either \"he\" or \"she\", but shouldn't get butt-hurt about it if someone doesn't go by what they ask. If a transgender person purposely gets a different person in trouble for simply \"mis-gendering\" them, that would be PURPOSELY being offended. Of course, if there were bullies that would be a different story. Overall, I believe that transgender individuals have the right to request that someone call them by a certain pronoun, but shouldn't go crazy when someone doesn't call them by that.  \\r\\nWords have the power you give them.</td>\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                     \\n  \\r\\nIt is not a privilege to drink in this country. A privilege is something that is given to someone who deserves it. Alcohol is not by any means something deserved but a drink like any other that all should be allowed at the age of 18 to consume. Why you may say... Well, at 18 years old if I am allowed to drive on my own, kill someone and go to jail for life, then why wouldn't I be able to sip a glass of wine? Compared to all of these other things, it really isn't that serious of a thing to allow people to drink.  \\n  \\r\\nSomething to point out would be that by prohibiting those who are 18 to drink, you are creating more of an issue in this country. People who are between 18 and 21 consume more alcohol then people who are 21 and above. This nature that they are forbidden to do so causes them to retaliate and drink more just in secret. In foreign countries like France, England, Spain, etc. the legal age of drinking is 18 and compared to America, they have less problems with drinking then America does. If we lowered the drinking age it would gradually decrease the amount of consumption by these 18-21 year olds because instead of going out on a thursday night and getting \"wasted,\" they can just simply have a glass or two every now and then.  \\n  \\r\\nRegarding the bill of rights, it is an outdated document altogether and should be revamped to include alcohol and other important rights like gay marriage. If they would go over and edit the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Constitution every 8 years as it was proposed, then it would better fit today's modern issues in society. Currently, as it stands, the Constitution itself sets the basis for our laws. It too discusses alcohol as being a right because the Constitution as a whole defines our rights. It may not be a natural right that we have at birth, however, it is a right that we do have.  \\n  \\r\\nBy changing it to 18 also, it will help reduce the number of deaths in this country each year that we have in drunk driving amongst teens because if they are allowed to drink then they won't be as reckless about it and they don't have to over indulge alcohol whenever they come into contact with it at parties and clubs since they don't know when they will get the chance to get some more.   \n",

make.  \\r\\nLet's take a look at the Bible, shall we? In the Bible, it states quite clearly in Leviticus 20:13 of the King Jame's Bible:  \\r\\nIf a man also lie with mankind, as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be on them.  \\r\\nNotice something? It's an abomination, not a sin. Now, dictionary.com defines an abomination as \"anything abominable; anything greatly disliked or abhorred.\" It also defines sin as \"any reprehensible or regrettable action, behavior, lapse, etc.; great fault or offense.\" Those are different definitions.  \\r\\nNow, let's search through the Bible to see some other abominations:  \\r\\nDeuteronomy: A marriage is not valid if a women is not a virgin, and she shall be executed if she is not.  \\r\\nMark: Divorce is not allowed.  \\r\\nOther rules:  \\r\\nNot having a round haircut  \\r\\nNot having a tattoo  \\r\\nNot associating with a women on her period.  \\r\\nworking on the Sabbath  \\r\\nwearing something of mixed fabrics  \\r\\nNot eating shellfish  \\r\\nNot playing with the skin of a pig (football)  \\r\\nMost Christians I know do not follow any of these rules. So why do they not consider these things sins but being gay a sin? Answer me that, please.   \n",

If the Bible says homosexuality is an abomination, I'm certain that those are pretty much the same thing. The sinner does not always regret, mind you.\"  \\r\\nYou're 'pretty' sure those two things are the same thing.  \\r\\nMy point is, being gay was listed as an abomination. Many of the abominations I have listed have been ignored by Christians because they decide those weren't relevant anymore. Responding also to the comment, those are laws from the Old Testament, which Christian also follow. (Ten Commandments, etc.) So if Christians excuse other abominations, why not being gay an list it as a sin?   \n",

While my opponent's case seems to be centered only on practicality, my case will surround both morality (as perceived by justice) and practicality in order to reach the optimum in the scope of the betterment of society.   Contention 1:   Denial of gay marriage creates second-class citizens.  The definition of second-class citizens is the following: \"an informal term used to describe a person who is systematically discriminated against within a state or other political jurisdiction, despite their nominal status as a citizen or legal resident there. While not necessarily slaves, outlaws or criminals, second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and economic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their putative superiors.\" At the point where the government is limiting the rights of homosexuals when it comes to the marriage they can have, this is inherently discrimination by the state against a group of people, creating a set of second-class citizens. When a marriage is only allowed for a heterosexual couple rather than a homosexual couple, it implies that a heterosexual couple is  more in worth than a homosexual one. Homosexuals have a right for protection against this sort of discrimination through the principles of social contract.   Contention 2  : Gay marriage benefits society.   On a more practical level, the legalization of gay marriage can be beneficial for society:      Sub-point 2a:   The supplement to tolerance of the homosexual community as a result of legalization of gay marriage has helped to reduce negative statistics in the homosexual community.   The proven evidence shows us that the negative statistics in the homosexual community, ranging from the amounts of sexually-transmitted diseases shared among homosexual patrons to the drug and alcohol abuse and suicide rates, have all been shown to be caused as a result of intolerance against the homosexual community. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention writes on homophobia and AIDS rates: \" Stigma and homophobia may have a profound impact on the lives of MSM, especially their mental and sexual health. Internalized homophobia may impact men’s ability to make healthy choices, including decisions around sex and substance use. Stigma and homophobia may limit the willingness of MSM to access HIV prevention and care, isolate them from family and community support, and create cultural barriers that inhibit integration into social networks.\" In the Emory University study provided, the study confirms that denial of gay marriage is a form of intolerance, and with the passage of legislation denying same-sex marriage, AIDS rates among homosexuals will increase by 4 per 100,000 cases, while legalizing will reduce by 1 per 100,000 cases.  As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain, intolerance is greatly negative for the health of the gay community:   \"Negative attitudes about homosexuality can lead to rejection by friends and family, discriminatory acts and violence that harm specific individuals, and laws and policies that adversely affect the lives of many people; this can have damaging effects on the health of MSM and other sexual minorities. Homophobia, stigma and discrimination can:\\r\\n  \\n  Limit MSM's ability to access high quality health care that is responsive to health issues of MSM  \\n  Affect income, employment status, and the ability to get and keep health insurance  \\n  Contribute to poor mental health and unhealthy behaviors, such as substance abuse, risky sexual behaviors, and suicide attempts  \\n  Affect MSM's ability to establish and maintain long-term same-sex relationships that reduce HIV & STD risk  \\n  Make it difficult for some MSM to be open about same-sex behaviors with others, which can increase stress, limit social support, and negatively affect health  \\n  \\n  The effects of homophobia, stigma and discrimination can be especially hard on adolescents and young adults. Young MSM and other sexual minorities are at increased risk of being bullied in school. They are also at risk of being rejected by their families and, as a result, are at increased risk of homelessness. A study published in 2009 compared gay, lesbian, and bisexual young adults who experienced strong rejection from their families with their peers who had more supportive families. The researchers found that those who experienced stronger rejection were:  \\n  \\n  8.4 times momore likely to report high levels of depression  \\n  3.4 times more likely to use illegal drugs  \\n  3.4 times more likely to have risky sex  \\n  4.0 times more likely to commit suicide  \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  The very same report explains that social support is the key toward reducing the problems of homophobia in the country and hence reduce the problems that result from this.   \\n  \\n  \\n  Sub-point 2b:   Legalization of same-sex marriage has been beneficial to commerce.  The following evidence of economy after the passage of legalization of same-sex marriage shows us that the legalization is a great supplement to commerce because of the increase of demand for products.   \n",
       "136081  \\n  \\n  When looking through my opponent's case, it isn't so much a case as much as it is an iteration as to what the burdens of my case are. I need to explain why marriage should be recognized in the first place with reasoning that allows for gay couples to be able to enter, and when going through his case, there are several things wrong with the reasoning therein.  Reproduction:   One of the things that puzzled me about my opponent's logic is where he transitions between humans having the lack of ability to reproduce at an individual level and him proposing that government should condone a unit that would compensate for this. My opponent states himself that two individuals can come in at any time and commence in the act that leads toward reproduction, but he states that this is not a solution with absolutely no reason why. This entire blank area makes the entire thesis of his case shaky at best because his premise is that marriage should compensate for this lack of ability to reproduce, but there's no warrant explaining why this needs to be compensated.  Characteristics of Marriage/Gay Marriage/ Infertile Couples/People Who Don't have Sex:   I put this all into one big category because it's the reasoning jumbled together in all of these main points from my opponent's case that really highlights the contradictions in my opponent's case. To reiterate, my opponent's main thesis is that marriage should compensate for the individual's lack of ability to reproduce independently, and when he outlines the characteristics of his idealized marriage and what a gay marriage is, it's come to my understanding that my opponent is trying to prove that there is no warrant for accepting gay marriage. My opponent talks about the objections that there are with infertile couples and states that his argument does not require children in a marriage, but this would mean that his entire thesis would be useless because it's dedicated toward upholding the biological function that reproduces children. If this is true, then my opponent's entire premise for being against gay marriage and upholding only heterosexual marriage is irrelevant. Not only this, but he stated himself that one of the objectives for marriage in his scenario is to raise children, and if infertile couples cannot reach this objective in his conception of marriage, they also should not be recognized under this scenario. My opponent then moves away from the argument he makes when he starts talking about people who don't have sex. He explains what a real marriage is, and beforehand states that this is what the government should accept, but then turns around and says that marriage policy is aimed at trying to recognize AS CLOSE TO real marriages as possible, meaning he's contradicted his own logic. In my opponent's logic of what constitutes a real marriage, gay marriage is not a real marriage and should not be accepted for this reason, but he states that people who have marriage not intended toward raising children (again, I emphasize, one of his key points about what constitutes a real marriage) does not constitute a real marriage, but they can still be recognized in the eyes of the government. This is a complete double-standard because it allows a leniancy toward such marriages but denies them to gay couples. In fact, my opponent even said himself that there are exceptions, but he in no way designates what these exceptions are and why they do not apply to gay couples.  African Americans:   For now, this argument doesn't go against his logic in any way, and it doesn't go against anything I have in my case, so for now, I'll leave it be.   I'll move on to my case now.  R1:   When going back to my opponent's case, he himself clearly allows leniancy toward marriages that are only warranted by desire considering the contradictions in reasoning between his thesis and his justification for infertile couples and people who don't have sex, but he tries to knock down my arguments because I'm somehow trying to make an argument with the idea of a marriage based on desire. Furthermore, he states that homosexual couples are intrinsically worth less than heterosexual ones and possibly it is because they do not use their organs in the fashion that my opponent specified, but this would also mean that the infertile couples and couples practicing celibacy or safe sex would also be intrinsically worth less, but he allows leniancy for them despite the fact that their marriages also contradict his standards of what a real marriage is and what kind of marriage should be legalized. It's becoming more and more apparent that my opponent's entire case is just discriminating against homosexuals with a double-standard. My opponent talks about how the reasoning in my first contention would justify other second-class citizens. It actually MIGHT (except in the case of pedophiles, who actually harm children and intake in the immoral action of taking advantage of a child, meaning they are out of social contract). My opponent pretty much begs the question in this argument by not stating why this would be a bad thing.  R2:   I must've accidentally missed to put up my sources. My fault. I'll place those in the comment section before the end of this debate. My opponent also states that the Emory University study is biased but provides no reasoning as to why. If we look at history, we realize that governments beforehand have had to enforce certain moral views in order to maintain its legitimacy. From the American government's perspective, for example, the abolishment of slavery, which also had contrasting moral views. However, this is looking at a case from a practical level rather than a moral level. Social integretiy and welfare is among the responsibilities of government, and this includes the betterment of public health. At the point where my case proves that public health is benefitted, what government would be doing by allowing gay marriages is trying reach the objective of maintaining the social unit. From a moral level, both our cases inherently enforce a moral idea voluntarily or involuntarily. Denying gay marriage would also be forcing moral views about homosexual acts and legitimacy of gay relationships because this action would support the people against such relationships. At the point where both our cases could validate a moral viewpoint based on my opponent's logic and my opponent is trying to hit my case at a moral level, he would have to prove that the moral viewpoint he would be supporting with his own case is better than the moral viewpoint that I would be supporting.  R3  : Their money MIGHT be spent in other establishments or resources, but there's a big gray area as to how much of that money would be spent. The official measure of an economy is the GDP (or GDI, which is equal to the GDP) and it only measures the amount of goods bought in one year. Over a period of time, a gay couple might spend X amount of money, but the economy's GDP is only specific to one year. The fallacy that my opponent accuses me of only depends on the assumption that these couples have the incentive to spend within this given year. A legalization would provide that incentive to increase the spending within that given year.       \n",

As such I will start my argument right away and reserve the last round for summary and conclusion, not adding any new arguments at that time.  I am afraid I must disagree with the second of Con's guidelines. While this is not a debate as to the existence of God, sin is not general malfeasance, it is specifically transgression of God's law or more broadly in my own Catholic faith anything that tends to separate man from God. Any discussion of sin must take into account this aspect, otherwise it would be a discussion of crime or immoral behavior generally and would not need to use such religious terms as \"sin\". Any argument about the social or personal effects of sin cannot avoid taking for granted the existence of God as the source of objective morality; the standard against which moral behavior must be judged. The premise itself takes sin for granted and simply seeks to surmise whether or not this has an effect on society. Let us start with some of the statements made by my partner in this debate and then move on to the premise I will be defending in this debate.  Sin has, from this religious standpoint an objective and subjective dimension. Something can be objectively sinful, and, due to ignorance, a person could not be culpable of engaging in that action. The person must be actively trying to correctly form his conscience, but the matter remains that those two dimensions exist. For mortal sin to exist in Catholic theology for instance there must be grave matter (something must be very wrong) full knowledge (the person must know this is wrong) and full consent of the will (I choose freely to do so anyways).  1. Humans do not commit \"sin\", but rather make mistakes and bad choices      The rationale given to support this assertion is that there is little or no evidence that homosexuality of converting from one religion to another is immoral. Were this true it would call into question whether or not homosexuality and converting to another faith are sins, not whether or not sin exists. In any case there is indeed a reason to consider both of these sins.  Homosexuality.   Sex is ordered towards the unitive and procreative capacities which lead to the formation of strong families and aid in raising healthy children. That is, sex draws a couple closer together in their commitment to one another and has the potential to create new life which this closely bound couple can then properly raise. To remove sexuality from this context goes against its true meaning and is therefore considered to be sinful. Homosexuality is such a case. You may disagree with it, you may argue with it, but it is not base assertion, but a reasoned position.  Apostasy  : Conversion in and of itself is not considered by any religion to be immoral. It is in fact considered to be the highest virtue when a person converts to the religion regarded as true. You call it conversion when someone changes to the true religion and apostasy when one changes from the true religion to a false one. This is also sinful in that it quite literally separates a person from the path revealed by God to draw people nearer to him, a sin against Truth. Once again, one may agree or disagree, but there is definitely reasoning behind it.  2. \"Judgmental\" God and society  The argument seems to be that people refrain from sinning because they are afraid of being judged by their peers or their God (in the first case facing ostracism and in the second eternal damnation). This may or may not be their true motivation, I cannot know. In any case it is irrelevant to the case at hand, which is whether or not it affects society.  Truth Matters  A society where people strive for truth and virtue is a better society. I do not mean that all men are virtuous in said society, or even that most men are virtuous; but if a determining number of that society actively seek out truth and attempt to live virtuously society will be better for it. Some people may be wrong about what constitutes sin and what doesn't, but this attempt to live virtuously (and at least avoiding sin in the subjective sense) will lead to a healthier society in that the person seeks the good of the community and his fellow man rather than his own good.  In the objective sense truth also matters. If it is true that homosexuality is a sin, then the promotion of that sin is contrary to the greater good of that society and this is detrimental to it. If it is true that homosexuality is not a sin, then to limit the expression of homosexuality or attempt to curtail what is billed as \"gay rights\" would be a sin and detrimental to society. Sin may be subjective in one sense, but truth does matter, and a society which does not turn its back on truth but lives according to it will be better off.    \n",

For that we would have to take too specific a viewpoint. If looked upon from a Catholic perspective, for instance, contraception would be a sin; this is not the case from the perspective of most protestants or for Buddhist. The same goes for the eating of pork. Most religions are fine with this, Judaism and Islam, however, see it as something prohibited by God which it is a sin, therefore, to consume. What I will attempt to prove in this debate is that if sin is a valid concept its effects on society will always be detrimental.  I will, however, defend my definition of apostasy. The dictionary does not take the viewpoint of a particular faith, so they opted to describe apostasy as the leaving of a religion. However, as it is religions that define sin and not Oxford linguists, it would be enlightening to see what different religious groups define as apostasy. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines apostasy as \"the total repudiation of the Christian faith\" (1) Islam, however, defines it as the abandonment of ones previous faith by a Muslim (2). They disagree about the definition of apostasy simply because they disagree about which religion is true.  Con is quite right to mention the fact that there are many different religions who all make truth claims. This, however, is not entirely germane to our conversation. For my side of this debate to be considered upheld it is enough to prove that in principle sin is bad for society, it is not necessary for me to prove which religious viewpoint on the matter of sin is the correct one. Whichever is true, the very fact that it is the truth makes it of greatest value to society.  \"Judgmental\" God and society  I fail to see how this is relevant. You mention bullying, which is also a sin, causes higher rates of suicide. This may be the case, but the case of a sin (bullying) against a person for committing a sin (acting on homosexual tendencies) causing a sin (suicide) -or if we do not accept homosexual behavior as a sin then the yet more terrible case of a sin against an innocent person causing a sin- is simply the very best example of my position. Sin is terrible for society.  Truth Matters  I do not see how my statement contradicts my logic. I pointed out there are reasons behind the belief that homosexual behavior is sinful, and then I say that whether or not it actually is sinful is irrelevant to the matter of the effects of sin on society.   Con also mentions the statement that \"a society which does not turn its back on truth but lives according to it will be better off\" is ambiguous. Let's try to clear it up with an example. Let us say that my opponent is correct in saying homosexuality is not a sin. This would then be the truth. A society that accepts this as true, does not put undue pressure on innocent people for their sexual orientation and is generally accepting of homosexuality and homosexual persons would be a more just society than one which does not. On the contrary, if I am right and homosexuality causes harm to both the individuals and society, then it would be a mistake not to separate the necessary respect for individuals from the harmful promotion of an objective harm. In either case, the truth of the matter is of vital importance; were society to get it wrong it would create an objective injustice.  It is true that a sin is a \"bad choice\", it is also a bad choice to listen to Britney Spears when you have the option of listening to Jimi Hendrix, but it is not a sin. \"Bad choice\" is also connotatively negative (it has the word \"bad\" in it, you can't get more negative than saying outright something is bad), the difference is that sin is rightly seen as something far graver than having bad taste in music. We are speaking particularly of the terrible choice of turning your back -by word, action or omission- from the ultimate Good.

       "460056                                               \\n  \\n  You get a call one day from a girl who’s stood you up three times. She says she’s back from out of town and asks if you’d like to get a drink on Saturday, and since you’ve never passed a stove you didn’t touch, plans are made. You meet at a bar. To your surprise, this time she shows up. You order a beer, start making small talk, seems like everything’s going well. You get up to pee, and when you get back, she’s ordered shots. She’s got a sly smirk on her face, a sly smirk you didn't make much of at the time, but that you'll remember until your dying day. You down the shot in one gulp and it tastes like sh!t.  \\n  “What is this?”   \\n  She responds, “G.”   \\n  You think she’s talking about gin, and you don't know better because you've never had gin before. Of course, she’s actually talking about GHB, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, commonly known as a date rape drug. A couple drinks later, the room is doing   Inception   things and you’re not sure what the fvck is going on. She takes you back to her place, semi-conscious, and once you’re alone, she forces more druggings down your lips. The whole night is a blur but you’ll never forget the moment she starts anally penetrating you – you’ve never done that before – and you’ve never felt so humiliated in your entire life. She knows what’s she’s doing, stimulates you in all the right places to get you hard, even though you want nothing more than for her to stop. Over the course of the night, you lose count of the times she rapes you. You’re sobbing and kicking and punching but you’re too weak to get her off you, and she doesn’t care – it’s all some sick roleplay in her mind.  \\n  When it ends, you think about going to the police. But you don't, because what if all your bros find out you were raped by some chick? You don’t think you can handle the humiliation, and you don't think the police will even believe you, and you hate yourself and your life, and you spend the next 5 years depressed, scared to have sex, getting panic attacks anytime you meet a girl in a bar, and constantly ideating suicide.   This debate is about trying to help men protect themselves from date rape. It's also a debate about sexism, because date rape protection tools are marketed towards women but not men, and that's a huge problem because male date rape is a very real thing.  I’m going to make two arguments. First, I’ll argue that the lack of date rape protection tools for men violates basic notions of fairness or justice. To make this argument, I’ll show that the lack of tools for men perpetuates (and is predicated on) sexist gender stereotypes. Second, I’ll argue that the lack of date rape protection tools for men is a net harm to society. Each argument affirms independently. The former affirms even if the lack of date rape protection tools is a net benefit to society, while the latter affirms even if the lack of tools is fair and just.  \\n  (1)  Male rape is more common than most poeple think. It's so common that the Justice Department recently updated its definition of rape to include men.   http://www.justice.gov...  The definition update was in response to a study by the Justice Department that found 1 in 33 men have experienced “a completed or attempted rape.”   https://www.ncjrs.gov...  Another study found that 12.9% of men are sexually assaulted at least once during their lifetime. This same study also found that male victims were 3.4 times more likely to be depressed and 2.4 times more likely to ideate suicide.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...  The male rape problem extends to date rape. Men are increasingly getting date raped. This is especially a problem in the gay community, which is known for its promiscuous hookup culture. Gay men are date raping other gay men, the same way the straight men date rape women. But the problem isn't limited to the gay community; men are getting date raped by women too.   Now, there's a few date rape protection tools on the market, but they're marketed exclusively (or at least almost exclusively) towards women. For example, one of the tools is a nail polish that changes colors when it comes into contact with date rape drugs. A girl can just put her finger in the drink to check it for drugs.  Developing and marketing date rape protection tools to women but not men is sexist. Marketing date rape protection tools exclusively to women sends a message that men aren't susceptible to date rape - and that messge is predicated on traditional (read: sexist) gender stereotypes. In this traditional worldview, men aren't victims of rape because women are smaller and weaker than me. Men aren't victims of rape because women aren't sexual in the same ways as men; they're not aggressors. The reality is differnet. Lots of men don't comply with these traditional gender roles. Lots of men are smaller/weaker than lots of women. Lots of men are feminine and lots of women are masculine.  The lack of date rape protection tools for men doesn't just discriminate against straight men who don't comply with traditional gender roles - it also discriminates against gay men. The entire gay community is excluded from the category of rape - they're treated like non-entities.  As such, marketing protection tools to women but not men is unfair to men and it's unjust - and it perpetuates sexist gender norms and contributes to homophobia.   (2)  The lack of date rape protection tools for men is also a net harm to society. This is because date rape protection tools will stop some rapes from happening. It will help some men protect themselves from date rape, both in a straight context and a gay context, and these men will benefit immensely by never being raped. It makes date rape harder to perpetrate.  What are the harms of marketing date rape protection tools to men? None. What are the benefits? Men get access to protection, which in turns lowers the rate of successful date rapes against men. The other benefit is that it sends a message to men that it's okay for them to be a victim of date rape - that it's not an affront to their masculinity. This will help men report date rape more, because they won't feel like it's something completely unaccepted by society. Sending a message that men can and are raped, and that men can and should seek help (i.e. from date rape protection tools, or from the police after a rape) is a massive benefit to men who are actually raped. These men won't get as depressed, they won't ideate suicide, and so on. Remember, men who are raped are more likely to be depressed and ideate suicide than women. Marketing date rape protection tools may lower that discrepancy by helping men get less depressed.  What are the harms of not marketing date rape protection tools to men? It communicates a message that men aren't ever victims of rape, which in turn contributes to the depression and suicide ideation experienced by men who are actually raped. It also means lots of men are gonna get date raped who might have prevented the date rape if they (a) knew male date rape was a thing, and (b) had bought protection tools to help them prevent date rape. What are the benefits of not marketing date rape protection tools to men? There are no benefits.    \n",

                      \\n  \\r\\nI mostly accepted this debate because being transgender is definitely NOT a mental disease.  \\n  \\r\\nAs for the pronouns, I will call transgender people what they prefer and look like. If they are a guy to a girl, I'm going to call them \"she\". Same with the other way around. Whenever agender people get purposely offended when I mis-pronoun them and freak out about it, that's a different story. If someone kept on calling me \"she\" even though I'm a he, I would be annoyed at first but could accept it despite it being not true. If someone who calls themselves an agender individual demands that they be referred to as \"ze\" or \"zir\", that's just ridiculous. We don't need to add any more words to the English language because of how they feel.  \\n  \\r\\nI will be happy to talk about this further if you would like.   \n",

I meant to ask how gender is NOT different from sex. That is my mistake. If you can, please answer it in the comments.  \\n  \\r\\nMental disorder and/or Gender Dysphoria is a better term for transgenders and agender people. When you said \"mental disease\" and \"mental illness\", that was what caused me to act. It was mostly the \"disease\" part of it.  \\n  \\r\\nThanks for answering the question. For the most part, I'm the same way but am more lenient on what transgender people want to be called (as long as it's an ACTUAL English word unlike \"zir\" or something like that). I believe that transgender people can request that others call them either \"he\" or \"she\", but shouldn't get butt-hurt about it if someone doesn't go by what they ask. If a transgender person purposely gets a different person in trouble for simply \"mis-gendering\" them, that would be PURPOSELY being offended. Of course, if there were bullies that would be a different story. Overall, I believe that transgender individuals have the right to request that someone call them by a certain pronoun, but shouldn't go crazy when someone doesn't call them by that.  \\r\\nWords have the power you give them.   \n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nThanks to TUF and donald.keller for engaging in this debate with us, and thanks to Skepsikyma for assisting me.  \\n  \\r\\nAs this is a policy debate, it should be assessed through the lens of net benefits. Our case will be compared either with the status quo or with a counter plan presented by Con, and voters should determine who won based on who produces the greatest benefit for all parties involved.  \\n  \\r\\nOur case is contextual to the topic. We need not specify just how many should be taken, only that Syrian refugees should be accepted into the U.S., and that the necessary costs be borne federally. Just as Con stated, when that refugee status ends, they would either be required to seek citizenship or return home.  \\n  \\r\\n1) Crisis  \\n  \\r\\nThere are 4.6 million people who have fled Syria, as of last month.[1] This is clearly the result of safety issues within a war-torn nation.[2] The number of refugees is still rising, and will keep rising for the foreseeable future. Still more are displaced within Syria itself, and they are likely to add to this number.[1]  \\n  \\r\\nCurrently, Turkey hosts 1.9 million. Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon have some 2.1 million.[3] Roughly 1 million have arrived in Europe, with the vast majority coming from Syria.[4]  \\n  \\r\\nThe problem is that the capacities and willingness of these nations to take on more people is not enough. Many go through Greece, where economic austerity has resulted in weakened protection systems for the poor. Asylum-seekers and refugees demanding the full attention of civil-society organizations, resulting in rampant xenophobia, intolerance, discrimination and even violence.[5] Europe as a whole is in such dire straits that there's a fear that the refugee crisis will tear it apart, with the Germans, their strongest economy, talking about shutting their borders and even reviving the Deutschmark.[6]  \\n  \\r\\nThe international system aimed at addressing the crisis is failing. \"[T]he EU's Schengen Agreement theoretically guarantees a baseline of free movement. However, the Dublin Regulation restricts asylum seekers to applying for relief in a single state, which mean that to reach their destination of choice... refugees must cross through multiple, and increasingly hostile, borders.\"[7] Borders are closed in Spain, Greece, Hungary, Turkey, Austria, Slovenia, Sweden, Serbia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. Many countries have even constructed fences to keep refugees out. Authorities are physically assaulting, violently clashing with, and arbitrarily imprisoning refugees at their borders.[7-14] These efforts \"drive people toward riskier, more chaotic overland or sea routes.\"[7] Almost 7,000 migrants are estimated to have lost their lives simply trying to travel to these locations, and that toll is likely to increase as more safe routes of transit vanish.[15]  \\n  \\r\\nAmong Middle East nations, Lebanon alone hosts 1 million refugees, which is dramatically overwhelming its population of less than 5 million people.[16] Refugees are pushed into legal limbo, subjected to fears of jail or harassment, and face long-term poverty as the benefits that Lebanon receives from the UN continue to shrink. Jobs are scarce and education more so as children are often forced to work in order to eat.[17] They've closed their borders, as have Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Jordan.[18] The situation in Jordan, with over a million refugees, is so bad that many are returning to Syria due to a lack of medical care, food and water.[19]  \\n  \\r\\nThe situation in these countries is desperate as cold temperatures put countless lives at risk in nations with limited resources and refugees still in limbo.[20]  \\n  \\r\\nThere's clearly a need here, and while some nations are making minor dents in that need,[21] many are blocking any route in for migrants, leading to what's been termed as \"The New Iron Curtains\".[22] The lack of avenues by which to exit the desperate situation in Syria ensures that millions of people will be left with a terrible choice: stay in war-torn Syria, or risk life and limb emigrating. This has led the UN refugee agency to call for 130,000 Syrians refugees to be resettled by the end of 2016.[23]  \\n  \\r\\nA U.S. commitment to register refugees advances the quality of life of those individuals and prevents deaths. It doesn't matter how many we accept - even if we go with the 10,000 Obama has already promised,[24] that would be a substantial benefit, returning to these people some semblance of safety and showing them basic humanity.  \\n  \\r\\n2. Duty  \\n  \\r\\nThe U.S. has made itself responsible for these refugees. Obama has already made that commitment, and to turn our back on that explicit agreement is tremendously detrimental to our international image, making the U.S. look like we're so paranoid about Muslim terrorism that we would ignore a humanitarian crisis and eschew our self-imposed obligation.  \\n  \\r\\nBut if that promise is not enough, our history should be. \"[T]he United States has given a home to some three million refugees since 1975. In 2013, they came from 64 different countries.\" We even created the U.S. Refugee Admissions program, a legislative framework dedicated to refugee resettlement and protection. Using that history, the U.S. can better couch its decision to take on these refugees, using past data to show that they will not be burdens on society and that their children will be cared for.[25] There's support among the population, as many citizens are even willing to open their homes.[26]  \\n  \\r\\nOur duty is also international. Other nations are taking on so many refugees because they recognize this is a crisis, but they're at or past their breaking point. The United Nations has submitted more than 12,000 resettlement cases to the U.S. for consideration.[27] We should consider them. Other countries know that the U.S. can take on refugees, and they expect us to help shoulder the load. To do otherwise would tell the international community and our allies that we don't care about their problems, spitting in their faces when they need our assistance.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Backlash  \\n  \\r\\nA large part of why ISIS is so successful is the result of their propaganda. It has been successful because we've failed to understand that \"the problem of the Islamic State [is] a political problem with a media dimension, not the other way around.\" Political realities are intrinsically linked to their messaging and thus, so long as the political realities exist, we cannot divorce them from the propaganda.[28]  \\n  \\r\\nTaking in these refugees is an opportunity to alter those political realities. By reducing all of the problems we've mentioned in our first contention, we're also denying ISIS fodder that continues to be used to recruit people from all across the world.  \\n  \\r\\nBut it goes deeper than that. Propaganda is most successful when the message being presented is facilitated by the facts, i.e. people aren't going to believe something just because they're told it's true. If they see evidence that shows that the propaganda is deceptive, then that propaganda loses much of its power to sway them. Right now, despite Obama's message of acceptance, many U.S. governors are actively banning the entry of refugees, and the result has been a general perception that Americans hate or fear these refugees.[29]  \\n  \\r\\nThat bolsters the Islamic State's legitimacy. Their messaging \"give[s] the impression of deep discomfort and even jealousy that the Muslim population the Islamic State so covets for its self-proclaimed 'caliphate' would rather live in 'infidel' Western lands.\" ISIS was happy to take responsibility for the Paris attacks because they \"calculate[d] that a small number of attackers can profoundly shift the way that European society views its 44 million Muslim members and, as a result, the way European Muslims view themselves.\" They want the West \"to equate refugees with terrorists. In turn, [ISIS] wants refugees to equate the West with prejudice against Muslims and foreigners.\"[30]  \\n  \\r\\nThus, taking in refugees has multiple benefits.  \\n  \\r\\nFirst, the treatment of those refugees who come here will stand as examples of good treatment of Muslims. This undermines ISIS propaganda and improves U.S. messaging abroad.  \\n  \\r\\nSecond, these Syrians will spread their personal stories by social media and other means. While messages from the U.S. itself may be written off, the various associations of these people with their fellow countrymen will lend credence to what they say.  \\n  \\r\\nThird, every refugee can interact with the general American populace, telling their stories about ISIS and the civil war. First-hand accounts will dramatically reduce the incentive for individuals from this country to go abroad and join ISIS. As some 30,000 people have defected and who are complicit in their terrorist actions, this is important.[31]  \\n  \\r\\nThe result of all this is a general failure of ISIS propaganda, which dramatically reduces their power. They require a caliphate to rule and people to conscript, not to mention an influx of people from without. In both cases, this functions against them, reducing the propensity for those in western nations, particularly Americans, to be drawn by that propaganda and reducing the general enmity of Syrian civilians for the U.S. While this may not be enough by itself to stop ISIS, it hamstrings them, reducing the effectiveness of one of their most potent weapons and improving the image of the U.S. abroad in the process.  \\n  \\r\\n1. bit.ly/1jsBiUu  \\r\\n2. brook.gs/1nuAu60  \\r\\n3. bit.ly/1jsBiUu  \\r\\n4. bit.ly/1jsBiUu  \\r\\n5. bit.ly/16cR1CA  \\r\\n6. huff.to/1PlT9XR  \\r\\n7. bit.ly/1OgTUnn  \\r\\n8. bit.ly/1Otpv5A  \\r\\n9. bit.ly/1PCtNp5  \\r\\n10. bit.ly/1PcNl9j  \\r\\n11. huff.to/1SsXQFL  \\r\\n12. bit.ly/1LbJu3K  \\r\\n13. bit.ly/1AC7QQo  \\r\\n14. bit.ly/1Nhzya3  \\r\\n15. bit.ly/1SsXVt5  \\r\\n16. nyti.ms/1HLPKPB  \\r\\n17. cnn.it/1OwfB1S  \\r\\n18. bbc.in/1ZwUMuu  \\r\\n19. bit.ly/1NhzCGH  \\r\\n20. bbc.in/1N7F6YJ  \\r\\n21. bit.ly/1lXxwGx  \\r\\n22. bit.ly/1KrpX0z  \\r\\n23. on.wsj.com/1EH06nV  \\r\\n24. bit.ly/1QauqJo  \\r\\n25. nyti.ms/1OOJIUF  \\r\\n26. reut.rs/23brH9u  \\r\\n27. 1.usa.gov/1JEkK7N  \\r\\n28. brook.gs/1n72nk4  \\r\\n29. cnb.cx/1MEd3wK  \\r\\n30. wapo.st/1S00Nue  \\r\\n31. nym.ag/1PCu23y</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nRebuttals  \\n  \\r\\n1. Crisis  \\n  \\r\\nThis point largely focuses on the crisis refugees face, and there limited options in safety. Going through my opponents argument here, he mentions that refugees face intolerance, discrimination,and violence. Unfortunately we believe that discrimination would be just as bad (maybe worse) with refugees inside the United States. Due to many recent events caused by ISIS, many Americans fear terrorism, and accepting refugees is the last thing many Americans want. Americans, in the past have always had a hard time treating refugees much better than other countries.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\r\\nThe major difference is now, we are under real threat of terrorism from a group of people coming from the very country these refugees are coming from. (1)  \\r\\nAmerica has a history of negative treatment of orientation's belonging to countries we were in war with. Okay it is 2016, and maybe times have changed from the mis-treatment of Japanese Americans from after WW2,(2) but blatant discrimination aside, these refugees may have a hard time finding jobs, and living and sustaining themselves economically.  \\r\\nThe US may be cheap compared to other European countries, but we aren't \"cheap\"... Especially our cities. Qatar, UAE, Lebanon, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia are far cheaper. In fact Saudi Arabia is half as cheap as the US (3). It's more practical to send poor, inexperienced people there. Refugees aren't guaranteed great jobs here. In fact, the US 2.5x as expensive as Syria for people with no jobs or foreseeable future. SA is only 0.5x more expansive. Pakistan is cheaper than Syria. Imagine taking poor people and throwing them into a world that is that much more expansive... It's like telling Americans they can only buy new cars... It'd destroy them.  \\n  \\r\\nWe agree with that the refugees have it bad, but America be so much better of an escape from crisis. My opponent mentions that accepting refugees into America will increase their quality of life, where as we wonder what kind of quality of life they would have here, under circumstances of worsened discrimination and financial instability.  \\n  \\r\\n2. Duty  \\n  \\r\\nThe resolution of this debate is whether the USFG   should   take refugees in, and while current events demonstrate that the plan has already been committed, that doesn't show reason for it being the right course of action. While the United States will likely go through with it's plan, our goal is to argue why the plan shouldn't have been made in the first place. However, would the international recourse that our opponent mentions really be so bad? And why should the United States Government value the opinions of international image over the opinions of it's own people, when copious polls seem to demonstrate that the vast majority of Americans not want these refugees? If the recourse was something serious like a world-war, that is one thing. But there are many other countries that do not allow refugees (as my opponent mentioned in his first point) who don't seem to be getting a lot of negative push back from the rest of world for not accepting refugees.  \\n  \\r\\nWe feel that it is a gross over-exaggeration to say that the USFG would be \"spitting in the faces\" of the U.N. by choosing to honor it's own citizen's concerns for National Security.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Backlash  \\n  \\r\\nWhile we agree that a large part of ISIS success is due propaganda, it doesn't reduce the fact that their is a lot of realism to both their threats, and that scares many people. My opponent mentions this as well however relates a large part of it to being subtle manipulation on ISISS' part to achieve their goals. The quote from his source (30) seems to be an inaccurate read of the situation. Rather than viewing Muslim refugees at a direct threat, Americans realize that it is unnecessary threat. Most people are not voting against having these Muslims in the country because of an understanding that they are \"all terrorists\".  \\n  \\r\\nMy opponent lists three ideals that he thinks will benefit from having refugees in the country.  \\n  \\r\\n1. \"Good treatment undermines propaganda\".  \\n  \\r\\nWhat about the bad treatment? As mentioned earlier, it is more likely that that than not many will receive some sort of discrimination based on current events. Even if there was more good than bad, the bad experiences will exist nonetheless, and that is what ISIS would focus on. It's impossible to \"undermine\" propaganda, when a terrorist group can add spin.  \\n  \\r\\n2. \"Social Media lends credence to fellow countrymen\"  \\n  \\r\\nThe pro world has a very \"Happy go lucky\" attitude about refugee treatment, that doesn't display realism in nature. Again with the good stories, there will also be the bad. This nullifies much of the \"good\" experiences will have. It is also un-realistic to assume this will be taken well from their country men. Hearing a positive story about someone who escaped a civil war into another country, most likely wont effect an \"entire country\" or even a large part of that country, to the extent of thinking that America and all of it's ideals are suddenly amazing. It is unrealistic because it hasn't worked that way in other countries who accept refugees.  \\n  \\r\\n3. \"Prevention of radicalization\"  \\n  \\r\\nThere is simply no evidence to support this theory, and if anything, even more so this supports the opposite in light of the San Bernadino massacre. Without direct stories, American's can see how bad it is over there. That didn't stop a couple from being inspired to join up to the cause. Also we are assuming by this logic that, all refugees share a firm singular opinion about the issue, which is very likely un-true.  \\n  \\r\\nSources:  \\n  \\r\\n(1)   http://www.pewresearch.org...  \\r\\n(2)   https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu...  \\r\\n(3)   http://www.numbeo.com...</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nThanks again to Con and let's do this.  \\n  \\r\\n1. Crisis  \\n  \\r\\nCon drops our arguments. Extend the extensive list of countries that are actively excluding refugees by closing their borders and violently defending them. Extend that the countries that are taking refugees are overburdened already, and that the situation for refugees in those nations is so absolutely desperate that many are returning to Syria. Extend that Syria itself is extremely unsafe due to the civil war, which has led to millions of displaced persons. Extend that these refugees can only take extremely dangerous routes into Europe, resulting in thousands of deaths in transit. And extend that these lives matter, regardless of their country of origin, and that to ignore their plight is to ignore their basic humanity.  \\n  \\r\\nThat is, fundamentally, what Con is doing. They haven't offered any alternate means of helping them. They've just said that we won't take them.  \\n  \\r\\nThe competing harms they've presented don't even compare. They have no home, no safety, no stability, nothing but the little they carry with them. To say that potential discrimination and a poor living standard is an upgrade is an understatement: they face violent confrontations with border guards and the lowest of living standards today.  \\n  \\r\\nBut neither of their claims are correct.  \\n  \\r\\nOn welcoming refugees,  \\n  \\r\\nWe presented a source last round that showed that many citizens are willing to open their homes to these refugees.[26] Over a thousand people would welcome these refugees into their homes in direct contradiction to Con's assertions. The so-called \"vast majority of Americans\" who don't want these refugees to come here is actually 52%, the actual vast majority (~80%) of which are Republicans.[32] That leaves 48%, some 150 million people, who aren't antagonistic to refugee arrival, most of whom are Democrats. As long as the resettlement program takes that into account and settles them in more liberal regions of the country, discrimination will be minimized.  \\n  \\r\\nOn cost of living,  \\n  \\r\\nWhile Con is correct that the cost of living is much higher in the U.S. than in Syria, that's not a reason to believe that they would be destitute. The vast majority of refugees have obtained jobs and self-sufficiency through the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement's efforts. Refugees are more likely to be employed than Americans, and 69% are self-sufficient after 180 days.[33, 34] Note that this is with successful admissions from Iraq and Burma,[35] and some 40,000 from Bosnia, which has a similar cost of living.[36] Data even indicates that refugees do far better than average in schools, meaning that we are actively raising their standard of living for when they return home.[37] But even if many of them stay poor, the basic support given to the poor in this country is still far better than anything they're going to receive from an almost solidly antagonistic Europe and an egregiously overburdened Middle East.  \\n  \\r\\nLastly, Con talks about 7 countries in which these people could live that are far cheaper. However, Jordan and Lebanon have already taken on way more refugees than they can handle, and the standard of living there is abysmal to the point that refugees are returning to Syria.[19] Jordan's even closed it's borders, as have Qatar, UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia have outright refused to take on refugees.[18] Iraq has accepted over 240,000 refugees,[38], but considering that they're also in the midst of major conflicts with the Islamic State, they're hardly a reasonable alternative.[39]  \\n  \\r\\n2. Duty  \\n  \\r\\nYes, this is a \"should\" resolution. That doesn't mean we're traveling back in time to before Obama made the promise and debating about what should have been done at that time. We're debating about what should be done now, and that means that our promises do exist. All \"should\" tells us is that, if we choose to reject the resolution, we will not take in refugees, but that doesn't mean that the negative response goes away. Just because that reality makes it harder Con doesn't mean that it should be rejected in favor of reversing time.  \\n  \\r\\nOur points are ignored. Con drops that the U.S. has more than sufficient capacity and the necessary framework to take on these refugees. They drop that rejecting our self-imposed burdens would send the worst kind of message regarding our views of Syrians: you're all potential terrorists unworthy of the basic human rights we bestow on so many other refugees. It's telling Syrians that we know they're in the most desperate of situations, but we can't be bothered.  \\n  \\r\\nBut that's just our self-imposed duty. Con just dismisses any international image problem as a non-issue, but ignores the context for why other countries would be upset. The costs of the migrant crisis on Europe are so staggering that the European Union can barely even determine what impact it's having on them. Sweden, which has closed its borders and doesn't require a fence to keep refugees out, is having to raise spending by 0.5% of GDP (roughly $28 billion) just to account for the population they have, their GDP is likely to fall due to widespread unemployment, and wages are set to drop as well.[40, 41] This tremendous stress on labor markets is resulting in mass unemployment among migrants, which is bound to get worse as millions more refugees keep migrating into Europe.[40] We pointed out last round, and Con has dropped, that the refugee crisis is set to tear apart Europe, throwing the economies of all member nations into disarray and recession.[6]  \\n  \\r\\nCon's response to all this is \"well, does that really matter?\" Of course it does! Telling the entire EU that their problems are not our problems, that they must bear the brunt of the refugee crisis, and that we will do nothing to assist them with the vast populations of Syrian refugees is a huge slap in the face when they're going through on the brink of yet another financial collapse. Ignoring the UN's request to even consider accepting these people treats our membership in that international group as purely nominal - after all, why bother listening to the body we helped found and currently lead? Why lead by example, showing other countries that they should accept refugees, when we could look after xenophobic and false personal interests? Con cares only about public perception of the decision to take these refugees, but there's no impact to people being a little upset with the government over a decision they disagree with. There's a substantial impact to telling Europe and the UN that we don't care about their problems.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Backlash  \\n  \\r\\nWhen Con concedes that ISIS is successful mainly based on its propaganda, they've already lost this point. Remember, they're actively supporting a system where we exclude every single Syrian refugee, reinforcing statements from people like Donald Trump that all Muslims should be excluded. That's the message that their case sends to the world: you're Muslim, and you're a potential national security threat. It doesn't help that 27% of the country wants to ban Muslims from the U.S.[42] Rejecting refugees would lend credence to the perception that that view controls our national policy.  \\n  \\r\\nAnd that's a message that ISIS would love to spread. It's really easy to do because there's absolutely no counter to it. There aren't people who are being treated well that can contradict it. There is only the negative.  \\n  \\r\\nWhat do we have if we accept some Syrian refugees? Sure, some may be mistreated, but discrimination isn't likely to result in anything dramatic like deaths or beatings, which they face in Europe and the Middle East. Many are likely to be treated well, and every single one of them functions as an example to the contrary. Every Syrian refugee with a job, a roof over their head, food on their plate, and no threat of impending death is an example that ISIS will have to suppress. They will have to work at that, with potentially thousands of stories showing up on social media.  \\n  \\r\\nCon doesn't explain why anything in our [30] is inaccurate. It focuses on what kind of messaging the Islamic State is pursuing, mainly how they want the West to be perceived. As a result of the U.S., as Con stated, \"honor[ing] it's own citizen's concerns for National Security\" and rejecting Syrian refugees, Con is actively feeding the message of prejudice and fear. This will be viewed as the same kind of rampant xenophobia and paranoia that ISIS has sold as being representative of the entire western world.  \\n  \\r\\nSo when Con talks about our 3 \"ideals\" (by which they should mean \"impacts\"), they ignore all of this link structure in an attempt to ignore them. It's still there.  \\n  \\r\\n1. Any good treatment is better than none. Good treatment always undermines propaganda, and that is entirely absent in Con's case.  \\n  \\r\\n2. It's not \"Happy go lucky\" to say that over a thousand people would gladly welcome refugees into their homes and that much of the population would not reject them. The messaging can only improve. As for the idea that the U.S. will be just like other countries in their experiences, a) we can easily control the flow of refugees into this country, b) we have a resettlement program with proven results, and c) our economy is far better off than most in the EU.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Once again, Con offers you no alternatives. They will allow tens of thousands to continue defecting without doing anything to address the messaging that's causing it. While many of these people may be disdainful of what they perceive as American propaganda, they will be much more likely to listen to first-hand accounts of the violence in the region, and reconsider their decisions. And no, we're not assuming that they share a singular opinion on the issue, just a singular experience: abject terror, the very thing that drove them to flee.  \\n  \\r\\n32. bit.ly/1UnDsUD  \\r\\n33. bit.ly/1JnIRsR  \\r\\n34. 1.usa.gov/1RKe518  \\r\\n35. 1.usa.gov/1PhhVwP  \\r\\n36. bit.ly/1rnR7hR  \\r\\n37. nyti.ms/1iur6wx  \\r\\n38. bit.ly/1mU1gP7  \\r\\n39. bbc.in/1nbXXmb  \\r\\n40. for.tn/20pVedu  \\r\\n41. bit.ly/1NwKznR  \\r\\n42. bit.ly/23pJ9ar</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nDEFINITIONS: Okay, I accept. Although, my opponent dooms himself. A timetable is not an immediate withdrawal: it sets up dates where a certain number of troops can leave. Therefore, the ‘Counter-plan' is stopped at the start. WE CAN DO BOTH. First we can soft partition, then leave.  \\r\\nSOFT PARTITION:  \\n  \\r\\nFirst off, most Iraqis want their country to remain unified. (  http://www.csmonitor.com...  )  \\n  \\r\\n\"Moreover, in poll after poll, a majority of Iraqis has indicated that they wish the country to remain unified. For example, the International Republican Institute reported in July 2006 that 66 percent of Iraqis opposed segregation by ethnicity or sect.\"  \\n  \\r\\nAlso, the U.S. is causing more problems. The reason most terrorists are terrorists is because they hate a person, cause, or group (in this case the United States). If U.S. troops killed one of the 80,000 civilians, and that person was in your family, you probably would seek revenge. (  http://balancedpolitics.org...  )  \\r\\n\"Much of the Muslim world resents the presence of American troops, and it is an easy source of terrorist recruitment and anti-American propaganda. The lifeblood of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is propaganda. To ensure successful continuance of their war, they must replenish their losses with a steady stream of new recruits. They also must be able to manipulate the press and weak politicians. In short, they must make themselves look like \"freedom fighters\". As long as American troops are in Iraq, all they have to do is put together videos showing soldiers in Muslim lands, as well as videos of Iraqi civilians suffering in hospitals. It won't matter to Al Jazeera &amp; other biased media \"reporters\" that almost all civilian deaths in Iraq are a result of the terrorist insurgent actions, the Americans will still get blamed. And a new generation of terrorists and America haters will continue to grow.\"  \\r\\nTherefore, by leaving, we solve the Sunni- Shiite- Kurdish conflict.  \\r\\nFinally, soft partition is immoral. This completely contradicts American values. We had ethnic separation, and look how that turned out. We should not prevent conflict by separating people: we should be trying to meld every person in the middle east into one big community.  \\n  \\r\\nCON #1 says soft partition is inevitable. That is a highly abusive argument. If it is inevitable, I have no ground to argue. It's like saying my shirt is white. It obviously is, and it's not arguable. Also that carries no weight. The fact that it is inevitable does not change whether it is good or not. Throw this card out.  \\r\\nCON #2 says 1 million would be dead. This card has no warrant. It simply makes a comparison to a Bosnia situation and throws an Iraq opinion in there. Also, as I said, much of the hate is ignited by Americans: something that can be solved.  \\r\\nCON #3 says that we have a moral obligation to help. I agree. But the way we do that is to leave Iraq. Once again please cross-apply the argument about how we are causing the problem. If we really want to prevent this conflict, we send aid to the UN to keep the peace or something of the like.  \\r\\nMY CASE: Cost- This is obviously a win for PRO. The cost of the war is costing the U.S. over $500 Billion. Bringing our troops home will free up billions of dollars that can be used to fix our economy, help decrease crime, and educate our children. THAT'S what we should be focusing on. Using a soft partition would possibly cost MORE, albeit making it go quicker, but it would take a lot of time and effort to do.  \\r\\nPretenses- My opponent again links it back to soft partition. Cross- apply my argument to the ‘Americans causing' and the ‘opinion' arguments to this one.  \\r\\nDeaths- my opponent concedes my case. Building a soft partition would lead to a LOT more deaths of Americans. Many Iraqis won't want to move and they will get mad at the U.S. They could go as far as to kill them. Again, that's why this war is immoral. We must keep our troops from dying. As for Iraqis, we've already killed 80,000 of them. I negated my opponent's argument about the 1 million dying. The best thing we could do is to just back away and let them live their lives.  \\r\\nOpinion- I DID answer this. Look at the first card. CSM says most Iraqis favor a unified country. 66% of the OVERALL population, not just specific groups, want a unified country. We should look at what the population wants, not just what individual ethnic groups wants. My evidence is superior.  \\r\\nThank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nI did ask for cogent arguments, and thus far you are disappointing. Although, I'll to the effort to point out your mistakes there in.  \\n  \\r\\nI contend that, as a 1996 study found, the ability to understand and perceive incompetence are exactly the skills lacking in the incompetent. I thusly gauge that your ability to declare people clueless may be impaired if you are yourself clueless. To accuse people, myself included, of voting against you on the grounds that they are kids not voting on logic is not a cogent argument. I submit that your arguments typically descend into rants about Muslims, the ACLU, Liberals and Communists. I contend that the voters, whoever they may be, do not view these as cogent arguments on topics ranging from hydrogen economies to the importance of the Bible. I contend that you have been shooting yourself in the foot rather than suffering from a grand conspiracy of teenagers out to get you.  \\n  \\r\\nYou argue that conservatives have tougher skins due to being older and wiser. I submit that many old conservatives go into hissy fits when told \"happy holidays\". I contend that this is not thick skin but rather the product of living in a culture where offensive material to older, white, Christian, conservatives has been largely removed from the public square.  \\n  \\r\\nYou stake your claim on two points, which quite honestly are four points: Science, engineering, history, and politics. I contend that youth in these topics is generally an advantage. For example, studies have found that that the peak years for discovery are between 18-25, after which most people become less productive. For example, Albert Einstein published three papers, proving atomism, laying the groundwork for quantum mechanics, and general relativity all in his early twenties. As he aged he never managed any breakthroughs of equal note.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have had debate on science topics. I have read these debates and found them wanting. First off, hydrogen is not a very effective alternative fuel for gasoline, you lost the debate that it was... two somebody in his forties with bad arguments himself. You were crushed on the topic of collidal silver because it's unscientific hogwash. It will perhaps turn you blue but it has never been shown to cure anything. You were demolished by a 19 year old whose argument was not only correct by scientifically justified showing an understanding of not only viral anatomy and and the immune system but the working of the FDA when it comes to nonsense.  \\n  \\r\\nHowever, we should be very careful here and note that the very essence of the argument is that young people are inherently inferior. A few people who schooled you in a debate and you claim to have won and that they were idiots, does not count as evidence of this universal claim. Just as having a white cat would not justify my claim that all cats are white.  \\n  \\r\\nAl Gore does not say the sky is falling, he says that global warming is real and the science is very much on his side.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have had a number of rants about Islam being a threat. This may be the case, however your case is poorly made on the subject. And you have thusly lost every issue. Nothing you have said here has any bearing on that.  \\n  \\r\\nYoung people are not fed anti-conservative propaganda they usually make decisions for themselves and understanding the issues and the morality at play choose to go against the conservative propaganda which typically tends towards incoherent rants.  \\n  \\r\\nLiberalism is has a good amount of logic behind a good number of ideas. And though people have feelings towards their positions that is not to be confused with people basing their position on feelings. Further, I contend, a good deal of conservative policies are fueled by hate and fear; last I checked those were emotions.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have made a number of points about your previous debates (typically incorrect points) and a number of points about liberalism. You have however made no argument as to how your pathetic performance in prior debates shows youths to be incompetent nor have you shown that the arguments for liberalism are incorrect or proved the impossibility that young people can be non-liberal. Which, if one is to argue that all liberals are wrong and all youths are liberals needs to be established.  \\n  \\r\\nFirst round: 0 cogent arguments. 1 offtopic rant.</td>\n",

       "1361    \\n  \\r\\nThanks to TUF and donald.keller for engaging in this debate with us, and thanks to Skepsikyma for assisting me.  \\n  \\r\\nAs this is a policy debate, it should be assessed through the lens of net benefits. Our case will be compared either with the status quo or with a counter plan presented by Con, and voters should determine who won based on who produces the greatest benefit for all parties involved.  \\n  \\r\\nOur case is contextual to the topic. We need not specify just how many should be taken, only that Syrian refugees should be accepted into the U.S., and that the necessary costs be borne federally. Just as Con stated, when that refugee status ends, they would either be required to seek citizenship or return home.  \\n  \\r\\n1) Crisis  \\n  \\r\\nThere are 4.6 million people who have fled Syria, as of last month.[1] This is clearly the result of safety issues within a war-torn nation.[2] The number of refugees is still rising, and will keep rising for the foreseeable future. Still more are displaced within Syria itself, and they are likely to add to this number.[1]  \\n  \\r\\nCurrently, Turkey hosts 1.9 million. Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon have some 2.1 million.[3] Roughly 1 million have arrived in Europe, with the vast majority coming from Syria.[4]  \\n  \\r\\nThe problem is that the capacities and willingness of these nations to take on more people is not enough. Many go through Greece, where economic austerity has resulted in weakened protection systems for the poor. Asylum-seekers and refugees demanding the full attention of civil-society organizations, resulting in rampant xenophobia, intolerance, discrimination and even violence.[5] Europe as a whole is in such dire straits that there's a fear that the refugee crisis will tear it apart, with the Germans, their strongest economy, talking about shutting their borders and even reviving the Deutschmark.[6]  \\n  \\r\\nThe international system aimed at addressing the crisis is failing. \"[T]he EU's Schengen Agreement theoretically guarantees a baseline of free movement. However, the Dublin Regulation restricts asylum seekers to applying for relief in a single state, which mean that to reach their destination of choice... refugees must cross through multiple, and increasingly hostile, borders.\"[7] Borders are closed in Spain, Greece, Hungary, Turkey, Austria, Slovenia, Sweden, Serbia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. Many countries have even constructed fences to keep refugees out. Authorities are physically assaulting, violently clashing with, and arbitrarily imprisoning refugees at their borders.[7-14] These efforts \"drive people toward riskier, more chaotic overland or sea routes.\"[7] Almost 7,000 migrants are estimated to have lost their lives simply trying to travel to these locations, and that toll is likely to increase as more safe routes of transit vanish.[15]  \\n  \\r\\nAmong Middle East nations, Lebanon alone hosts 1 million refugees, which is dramatically overwhelming its population of less than 5 million people.[16] Refugees are pushed into legal limbo, subjected to fears of jail or harassment, and face long-term poverty as the benefits that Lebanon receives from the UN continue to shrink. Jobs are scarce and education more so as children are often forced to work in order to eat.[17] They've closed their borders, as have Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and Jordan.[18] The situation in Jordan, with over a million refugees, is so bad that many are returning to Syria due to a lack of medical care, food and water.[19]  \\n  \\r\\nThe situation in these countries is desperate as cold temperatures put countless lives at risk in nations with limited resources and refugees still in limbo.[20]  \\n  \\r\\nThere's clearly a need here, and while some nations are making minor dents in that need,[21] many are blocking any route in for migrants, leading to what's been termed as \"The New Iron Curtains\".[22] The lack of avenues by which to exit the desperate situation in Syria ensures that millions of people will be left with a terrible choice: stay in war-torn Syria, or risk life and limb emigrating. This has led the UN refugee agency to call for 130,000 Syrians refugees to be resettled by the end of 2016.[23]  \\n  \\r\\nA U.S. commitment to register refugees advances the quality of life of those individuals and prevents deaths. It doesn't matter how many we accept - even if we go with the 10,000 Obama has already promised,[24] that would be a substantial benefit, returning to these people some semblance of safety and showing them basic humanity.  \\n  \\r\\n2. Duty  \\n  \\r\\nThe U.S. has made itself responsible for these refugees. Obama has already made that commitment, and to turn our back on that explicit agreement is tremendously detrimental to our international image, making the U.S. look like we're so paranoid about Muslim terrorism that we would ignore a humanitarian crisis and eschew our self-imposed obligation.  \\n  \\r\\nBut if that promise is not enough, our history should be. \"[T]he United States has given a home to some three million refugees since 1975. In 2013, they came from 64 different countries.\" We even created the U.S. Refugee Admissions program, a legislative framework dedicated to refugee resettlement and protection. Using that history, the U.S. can better couch its decision to take on these refugees, using past data to show that they will not be burdens on society and that their children will be cared for.[25] There's support among the population, as many citizens are even willing to open their homes.[26]  \\n  \\r\\nOur duty is also international. Other nations are taking on so many refugees because they recognize this is a crisis, but they're at or past their breaking point. The United Nations has submitted more than 12,000 resettlement cases to the U.S. for consideration.[27] We should consider them. Other countries know that the U.S. can take on refugees, and they expect us to help shoulder the load. To do otherwise would tell the international community and our allies that we don't care about their problems, spitting in their faces when they need our assistance.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Backlash  \\n  \\r\\nA large part of why ISIS is so successful is the result of their propaganda. It has been successful because we've failed to understand that \"the problem of the Islamic State [is] a political problem with a media dimension, not the other way around.\" Political realities are intrinsically linked to their messaging and thus, so long as the political realities exist, we cannot divorce them from the propaganda.[28]  \\n  \\r\\nTaking in these refugees is an opportunity to alter those political realities. By reducing all of the problems we've mentioned in our first contention, we're also denying ISIS fodder that continues to be used to recruit people from all across the world.  \\n  \\r\\nBut it goes deeper than that. Propaganda is most successful when the message being presented is facilitated by the facts, i.e. people aren't going to believe something just because they're told it's true. If they see evidence that shows that the propaganda is deceptive, then that propaganda loses much of its power to sway them. Right now, despite Obama's message of acceptance, many U.S. governors are actively banning the entry of refugees, and the result has been a general perception that Americans hate or fear these refugees.[29]  \\n  \\r\\nThat bolsters the Islamic State's legitimacy. Their messaging \"give[s] the impression of deep discomfort and even jealousy that the Muslim population the Islamic State so covets for its self-proclaimed 'caliphate' would rather live in 'infidel' Western lands.\" ISIS was happy to take responsibility for the Paris attacks because they \"calculate[d] that a small number of attackers can profoundly shift the way that European society views its 44 million Muslim members and, as a result, the way European Muslims view themselves.\" They want the West \"to equate refugees with terrorists. In turn, [ISIS] wants refugees to equate the West with prejudice against Muslims and foreigners.\"[30]  \\n  \\r\\nThus, taking in refugees has multiple benefits.  \\n  \\r\\nFirst, the treatment of those refugees who come here will stand as examples of good treatment of Muslims. This undermines ISIS propaganda and improves U.S. messaging abroad.  \\n  \\r\\nSecond, these Syrians will spread their personal stories by social media and other means. While messages from the U.S. itself may be written off, the various associations of these people with their fellow countrymen will lend credence to what they say.  \\n  \\r\\nThird, every refugee can interact with the general American populace, telling their stories about ISIS and the civil war. First-hand accounts will dramatically reduce the incentive for individuals from this country to go abroad and join ISIS. As some 30,000 people have defected and who are complicit in their terrorist actions, this is important.[31]  \\n  \\r\\nThe result of all this is a general failure of ISIS propaganda, which dramatically reduces their power. They require a caliphate to rule and people to conscript, not to mention an influx of people from without. In both cases, this functions against them, reducing the propensity for those in western nations, particularly Americans, to be drawn by that propaganda and reducing the general enmity of Syrian civilians for the U.S. While this may not be enough by itself to stop ISIS, it hamstrings them, reducing the effectiveness of one of their most potent weapons and improving the image of the U.S. abroad in the process.  \\n  \\r\\n1. bit.ly/1jsBiUu  \\r\\n2. brook.gs/1nuAu60  \\r\\n3. bit.ly/1jsBiUu  \\r\\n4. bit.ly/1jsBiUu  \\r\\n5. bit.ly/16cR1CA  \\r\\n6. huff.to/1PlT9XR  \\r\\n7. bit.ly/1OgTUnn  \\r\\n8. bit.ly/1Otpv5A  \\r\\n9. bit.ly/1PCtNp5  \\r\\n10. bit.ly/1PcNl9j  \\r\\n11. huff.to/1SsXQFL  \\r\\n12. bit.ly/1LbJu3K  \\r\\n13. bit.ly/1AC7QQo  \\r\\n14. bit.ly/1Nhzya3  \\r\\n15. bit.ly/1SsXVt5  \\r\\n16. nyti.ms/1HLPKPB  \\r\\n17. cnn.it/1OwfB1S  \\r\\n18. bbc.in/1ZwUMuu  \\r\\n19. bit.ly/1NhzCGH  \\r\\n20. bbc.in/1N7F6YJ  \\r\\n21. bit.ly/1lXxwGx  \\r\\n22. bit.ly/1KrpX0z  \\r\\n23. on.wsj.com/1EH06nV  \\r\\n24. bit.ly/1QauqJo  \\r\\n25. nyti.ms/1OOJIUF  \\r\\n26. reut.rs/23brH9u  \\r\\n27. 1.usa.gov/1JEkK7N  \\r\\n28. brook.gs/1n72nk4  \\r\\n29. cnb.cx/1MEd3wK  \\r\\n30. wapo.st/1S00Nue  \\r\\n31. nym.ag/1PCu23y   \n",

Crisis  \\n  \\r\\nThis point largely focuses on the crisis refugees face, and there limited options in safety. Going through my opponents argument here, he mentions that refugees face intolerance, discrimination,and violence. Unfortunately we believe that discrimination would be just as bad (maybe worse) with refugees inside the United States. Due to many recent events caused by ISIS, many Americans fear terrorism, and accepting refugees is the last thing many Americans want. Americans, in the past have always had a hard time treating refugees much better than other countries.  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\r\\nThe major difference is now, we are under real threat of terrorism from a group of people coming from the very country these refugees are coming from. (1)  \\r\\nAmerica has a history of negative treatment of orientation's belonging to countries we were in war with. Okay it is 2016, and maybe times have changed from the mis-treatment of Japanese Americans from after WW2,(2) but blatant discrimination aside, these refugees may have a hard time finding jobs, and living and sustaining themselves economically.  \\r\\nThe US may be cheap compared to other European countries, but we aren't \"cheap\"... Especially our cities. Qatar, UAE, Lebanon, Oman, Jordan, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia are far cheaper. In fact Saudi Arabia is half as cheap as the US (3). It's more practical to send poor, inexperienced people there. Refugees aren't guaranteed great jobs here. In fact, the US 2.5x as expensive as Syria for people with no jobs or foreseeable future. SA is only 0.5x more expansive. Pakistan is cheaper than Syria. Imagine taking poor people and throwing them into a world that is that much more expansive... It's like telling Americans they can only buy new cars... It'd destroy them.  \\n  \\r\\nWe agree with that the refugees have it bad, but America be so much better of an escape from crisis. My opponent mentions that accepting refugees into America will increase their quality of life, where as we wonder what kind of quality of life they would have here, under circumstances of worsened discrimination and financial instability.  \\n  \\r\\n2. Duty  \\n  \\r\\nThe resolution of this debate is whether the USFG   should   take refugees in, and while current events demonstrate that the plan has already been committed, that doesn't show reason for it being the right course of action. While the United States will likely go through with it's plan, our goal is to argue why the plan shouldn't have been made in the first place. However, would the international recourse that our opponent mentions really be so bad? And why should the United States Government value the opinions of international image over the opinions of it's own people, when copious polls seem to demonstrate that the vast majority of Americans not want these refugees? If the recourse was something serious like a world-war, that is one thing. But there are many other countries that do not allow refugees (as my opponent mentioned in his first point) who don't seem to be getting a lot of negative push back from the rest of world for not accepting refugees.  \\n  \\r\\nWe feel that it is a gross over-exaggeration to say that the USFG would be \"spitting in the faces\" of the U.N. by choosing to honor it's own citizen's concerns for National Security.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Backlash  \\n  \\r\\nWhile we agree that a large part of ISIS success is due propaganda, it doesn't reduce the fact that their is a lot of realism to both their threats, and that scares many people. My opponent mentions this as well however relates a large part of it to being subtle manipulation on ISISS' part to achieve their goals. The quote from his source (30) seems to be an inaccurate read of the situation. Rather than viewing Muslim refugees at a direct threat, Americans realize that it is unnecessary threat. Most people are not voting against having these Muslims in the country because of an understanding that they are \"all terrorists\".  \\n  \\r\\nMy opponent lists three ideals that he thinks will benefit from having refugees in the country.  \\n  \\r\\n1. \"Good treatment undermines propaganda\".  \\n  \\r\\nWhat about the bad treatment? As mentioned earlier, it is more likely that that than not many will receive some sort of discrimination based on current events. Even if there was more good than bad, the bad experiences will exist nonetheless, and that is what ISIS would focus on. It's impossible to \"undermine\" propaganda, when a terrorist group can add spin.  \\n  \\r\\n2. \"Social Media lends credence to fellow countrymen\"  \\n  \\r\\nThe pro world has a very \"Happy go lucky\" attitude about refugee treatment, that doesn't display realism in nature. Again with the good stories, there will also be the bad. This nullifies much of the \"good\" experiences will have. It is also un-realistic to assume this will be taken well from their country men. Hearing a positive story about someone who escaped a civil war into another country, most likely wont effect an \"entire country\" or even a large part of that country, to the extent of thinking that America and all of it's ideals are suddenly amazing. It is unrealistic because it hasn't worked that way in other countries who accept refugees.  \\n  \\r\\n3. \"Prevention of radicalization\"  \\n  \\r\\nThere is simply no evidence to support this theory, and if anything, even more so this supports the opposite in light of the San Bernadino massacre. Without direct stories, American's can see how bad it is over there. That didn't stop a couple from being inspired to join up to the cause. Also we are assuming by this logic that, all refugees share a firm singular opinion about the issue, which is very likely un-true.  \\n  \\r\\nSources:  \\n  \\r\\n(1)   http://www.pewresearch.org...  \\r\\n(2)   https://artifactsjournal.missouri.edu...  \\r\\n(3)   http://www.numbeo.com...   \n",
       "1363                                                                                                                  \\n  \\r\\nThanks again to Con and let's do this.  \\n  \\r\\n1. Crisis  \\n  \\r\\nCon drops our arguments. Extend the extensive list of countries that are actively excluding refugees by closing their borders and violently defending them. Extend that the countries that are taking refugees are overburdened already, and that the situation for refugees in those nations is so absolutely desperate that many are returning to Syria. Extend that Syria itself is extremely unsafe due to the civil war, which has led to millions of displaced persons. Extend that these refugees can only take extremely dangerous routes into Europe, resulting in thousands of deaths in transit. And extend that these lives matter, regardless of their country of origin, and that to ignore their plight is to ignore their basic humanity.  \\n  \\r\\nThat is, fundamentally, what Con is doing. They haven't offered any alternate means of helping them. They've just said that we won't take them.  \\n  \\r\\nThe competing harms they've presented don't even compare. They have no home, no safety, no stability, nothing but the little they carry with them. To say that potential discrimination and a poor living standard is an upgrade is an understatement: they face violent confrontations with border guards and the lowest of living standards today.  \\n  \\r\\nBut neither of their claims are correct.  \\n  \\r\\nOn welcoming refugees,  \\n  \\r\\nWe presented a source last round that showed that many citizens are willing to open their homes to these refugees.[26] Over a thousand people would welcome these refugees into their homes in direct contradiction to Con's assertions. The so-called \"vast majority of Americans\" who don't want these refugees to come here is actually 52%, the actual vast majority (~80%) of which are Republicans.[32] That leaves 48%, some 150 million people, who aren't antagonistic to refugee arrival, most of whom are Democrats. As long as the resettlement program takes that into account and settles them in more liberal regions of the country, discrimination will be minimized.  \\n  \\r\\nOn cost of living,  \\n  \\r\\nWhile Con is correct that the cost of living is much higher in the U.S. than in Syria, that's not a reason to believe that they would be destitute. The vast majority of refugees have obtained jobs and self-sufficiency through the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement's efforts. Refugees are more likely to be employed than Americans, and 69% are self-sufficient after 180 days.[33, 34] Note that this is with successful admissions from Iraq and Burma,[35] and some 40,000 from Bosnia, which has a similar cost of living.[36] Data even indicates that refugees do far better than average in schools, meaning that we are actively raising their standard of living for when they return home.[37] But even if many of them stay poor, the basic support given to the poor in this country is still far better than anything they're going to receive from an almost solidly antagonistic Europe and an egregiously overburdened Middle East.  \\n  \\r\\nLastly, Con talks about 7 countries in which these people could live that are far cheaper. However, Jordan and Lebanon have already taken on way more refugees than they can handle, and the standard of living there is abysmal to the point that refugees are returning to Syria.[19] Jordan's even closed it's borders, as have Qatar, UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia have outright refused to take on refugees.[18] Iraq has accepted over 240,000 refugees,[38], but considering that they're also in the midst of major conflicts with the Islamic State, they're hardly a reasonable alternative.[39]  \\n  \\r\\n2. Duty  \\n  \\r\\nYes, this is a \"should\" resolution. That doesn't mean we're traveling back in time to before Obama made the promise and debating about what should have been done at that time. We're debating about what should be done now, and that means that our promises do exist. All \"should\" tells us is that, if we choose to reject the resolution, we will not take in refugees, but that doesn't mean that the negative response goes away. Just because that reality makes it harder Con doesn't mean that it should be rejected in favor of reversing time.  \\n  \\r\\nOur points are ignored. Con drops that the U.S. has more than sufficient capacity and the necessary framework to take on these refugees. They drop that rejecting our self-imposed burdens would send the worst kind of message regarding our views of Syrians: you're all potential terrorists unworthy of the basic human rights we bestow on so many other refugees. It's telling Syrians that we know they're in the most desperate of situations, but we can't be bothered.  \\n  \\r\\nBut that's just our self-imposed duty. Con just dismisses any international image problem as a non-issue, but ignores the context for why other countries would be upset. The costs of the migrant crisis on Europe are so staggering that the European Union can barely even determine what impact it's having on them. Sweden, which has closed its borders and doesn't require a fence to keep refugees out, is having to raise spending by 0.5% of GDP (roughly $28 billion) just to account for the population they have, their GDP is likely to fall due to widespread unemployment, and wages are set to drop as well.[40, 41] This tremendous stress on labor markets is resulting in mass unemployment among migrants, which is bound to get worse as millions more refugees keep migrating into Europe.[40] We pointed out last round, and Con has dropped, that the refugee crisis is set to tear apart Europe, throwing the economies of all member nations into disarray and recession.[6]  \\n  \\r\\nCon's response to all this is \"well, does that really matter?\" Of course it does! Telling the entire EU that their problems are not our problems, that they must bear the brunt of the refugee crisis, and that we will do nothing to assist them with the vast populations of Syrian refugees is a huge slap in the face when they're going through on the brink of yet another financial collapse. Ignoring the UN's request to even consider accepting these people treats our membership in that international group as purely nominal - after all, why bother listening to the body we helped found and currently lead? Why lead by example, showing other countries that they should accept refugees, when we could look after xenophobic and false personal interests? Con cares only about public perception of the decision to take these refugees, but there's no impact to people being a little upset with the government over a decision they disagree with. There's a substantial impact to telling Europe and the UN that we don't care about their problems.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Backlash  \\n  \\r\\nWhen Con concedes that ISIS is successful mainly based on its propaganda, they've already lost this point. Remember, they're actively supporting a system where we exclude every single Syrian refugee, reinforcing statements from people like Donald Trump that all Muslims should be excluded. That's the message that their case sends to the world: you're Muslim, and you're a potential national security threat. It doesn't help that 27% of the country wants to ban Muslims from the U.S.[42] Rejecting refugees would lend credence to the perception that that view controls our national policy.  \\n  \\r\\nAnd that's a message that ISIS would love to spread. It's really easy to do because there's absolutely no counter to it. There aren't people who are being treated well that can contradict it. There is only the negative.  \\n  \\r\\nWhat do we have if we accept some Syrian refugees? Sure, some may be mistreated, but discrimination isn't likely to result in anything dramatic like deaths or beatings, which they face in Europe and the Middle East. Many are likely to be treated well, and every single one of them functions as an example to the contrary. Every Syrian refugee with a job, a roof over their head, food on their plate, and no threat of impending death is an example that ISIS will have to suppress. They will have to work at that, with potentially thousands of stories showing up on social media.  \\n  \\r\\nCon doesn't explain why anything in our [30] is inaccurate. It focuses on what kind of messaging the Islamic State is pursuing, mainly how they want the West to be perceived. As a result of the U.S., as Con stated, \"honor[ing] it's own citizen's concerns for National Security\" and rejecting Syrian refugees, Con is actively feeding the message of prejudice and fear. This will be viewed as the same kind of rampant xenophobia and paranoia that ISIS has sold as being representative of the entire western world.  \\n  \\r\\nSo when Con talks about our 3 \"ideals\" (by which they should mean \"impacts\"), they ignore all of this link structure in an attempt to ignore them. It's still there.  \\n  \\r\\n1. Any good treatment is better than none. Good treatment always undermines propaganda, and that is entirely absent in Con's case.  \\n  \\r\\n2. It's not \"Happy go lucky\" to say that over a thousand people would gladly welcome refugees into their homes and that much of the population would not reject them. The messaging can only improve. As for the idea that the U.S. will be just like other countries in their experiences, a) we can easily control the flow of refugees into this country, b) we have a resettlement program with proven results, and c) our economy is far better off than most in the EU.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Once again, Con offers you no alternatives. They will allow tens of thousands to continue defecting without doing anything to address the messaging that's causing it. While many of these people may be disdainful of what they perceive as American propaganda, they will be much more likely to listen to first-hand accounts of the violence in the region, and reconsider their decisions. And no, we're not assuming that they share a singular opinion on the issue, just a singular experience: abject terror, the very thing that drove them to flee.  \\n  \\r\\n32. bit.ly/1UnDsUD  \\r\\n33. bit.ly/1JnIRsR  \\r\\n34. 1.usa.gov/1RKe518  \\r\\n35. 1.usa.gov/1PhhVwP  \\r\\n36. bit.ly/1rnR7hR  \\r\\n37. nyti.ms/1iur6wx  \\r\\n38. bit.ly/1mU1gP7  \\r\\n39. bbc.in/1nbXXmb  \\r\\n40. for.tn/20pVedu  \\r\\n41. bit.ly/1NwKznR  \\r\\n42. bit.ly/23pJ9ar   \n",

              \\n  \\r\\nDEFINITIONS: Okay, I accept. Although, my opponent dooms himself. A timetable is not an immediate withdrawal: it sets up dates where a certain number of troops can leave. Therefore, the ‘Counter-plan' is stopped at the start. WE CAN DO BOTH. First we can soft partition, then leave.  \\r\\nSOFT PARTITION:  \\n  \\r\\nFirst off, most Iraqis want their country to remain unified. (  http://www.csmonitor.com...  )  \\n  \\r\\n\"Moreover, in poll after poll, a majority of Iraqis has indicated that they wish the country to remain unified. For example, the International Republican Institute reported in July 2006 that 66 percent of Iraqis opposed segregation by ethnicity or sect.\"  \\n  \\r\\nAlso, the U.S. is causing more problems. The reason most terrorists are terrorists is because they hate a person, cause, or group (in this case the United States). If U.S. troops killed one of the 80,000 civilians, and that person was in your family, you probably would seek revenge. (  http://balancedpolitics.org...  )  \\r\\n\"Much of the Muslim world resents the presence of American troops, and it is an easy source of terrorist recruitment and anti-American propaganda. The lifeblood of Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups is propaganda. To ensure successful continuance of their war, they must replenish their losses with a steady stream of new recruits. They also must be able to manipulate the press and weak politicians. In short, they must make themselves look like \"freedom fighters\". As long as American troops are in Iraq, all they have to do is put together videos showing soldiers in Muslim lands, as well as videos of Iraqi civilians suffering in hospitals. It won't matter to Al Jazeera & other biased media \"reporters\" that almost all civilian deaths in Iraq are a result of the terrorist insurgent actions, the Americans will still get blamed. And a new generation of terrorists and America haters will continue to grow.\"  \\r\\nTherefore, by leaving, we solve the Sunni- Shiite- Kurdish conflict.  \\r\\nFinally, soft partition is immoral. This completely contradicts American values. We had ethnic separation, and look how that turned out. We should not prevent conflict by separating people: we should be trying to meld every person in the middle east into one big community.  \\n  \\r\\nCON #1 says soft partition is inevitable. That is a highly abusive argument. If it is inevitable, I have no ground to argue. It's like saying my shirt is white. It obviously is, and it's not arguable. Also that carries no weight. The fact that it is inevitable does not change whether it is good or not. Throw this card out.  \\r\\nCON #2 says 1 million would be dead. This card has no warrant. It simply makes a comparison to a Bosnia situation and throws an Iraq opinion in there. Also, as I said, much of the hate is ignited by Americans: something that can be solved.  \\r\\nCON #3 says that we have a moral obligation to help. I agree. But the way we do that is to leave Iraq. Once again please cross-apply the argument about how we are causing the problem. If we really want to prevent this conflict, we send aid to the UN to keep the peace or something of the like.  \\r\\nMY CASE: Cost- This is obviously a win for PRO. The cost of the war is costing the U.S. over $500 Billion. Bringing our troops home will free up billions of dollars that can be used to fix our economy, help decrease crime, and educate our children. THAT'S what we should be focusing on. Using a soft partition would possibly cost MORE, albeit making it go quicker, but it would take a lot of time and effort to do.  \\r\\nPretenses- My opponent again links it back to soft partition. Cross- apply my argument to the ‘Americans causing' and the ‘opinion' arguments to this one.  \\r\\nDeaths- my opponent concedes my case. Building a soft partition would lead to a LOT more deaths of Americans. Many Iraqis won't want to move and they will get mad at the U.S. They could go as far as to kill them. Again, that's why this war is immoral. We must keep our troops from dying. As for Iraqis, we've already killed 80,000 of them. I negated my opponent's argument about the 1 million dying. The best thing we could do is to just back away and let them live their lives.  \\r\\nOpinion- I DID answer this. Look at the first card. CSM says most Iraqis favor a unified country. 66% of the OVERALL population, not just specific groups, want a unified country. We should look at what the population wants, not just what individual ethnic groups wants. My evidence is superior.  \\r\\nThank you.   \n",

construct...this is why there are about 15 million estimated JEWS on EARTH....meaning less compared to the Billion plus JESUS sheeple and the Billion plus Allah sheeple...the monotheistic GOD concept is obviously NOT VIABLE...this is why 3 versions of Middle East based GODs and Dogma are within a very small region of the planet...the so called GOD is irrelevant...WHY ?  \\n  \\r\\nAt some point the JEWS backed off the Old Testament enforcement of HOW TO EXIST....the JEW does not assimilate others using FEAR-INTIMIDATION-VIOLENCE...the Old Testament is a psychotic blood bath....the JEW would be totally exterminated.... if they tried the assimilation of humanity GAME...using the Old Testament as it is written LITERALLY...  \\n  \\r\\nNor so with the JESUS and ALLAH slavers....The Roman Church went on a RAMPAGE of DEATH and DESTRUCTION in collusion with POWERS of the time...the JEW tooka back seat and stayed under the RADAR...still they were persecuted relentlessly...  \\n  \\r\\n600 years after the Jesus invention MUHAMMAD has a similar meetup with a GOD like MOSES ? he was ILLITERATE and his followers came up with the KORAN...which like the Christian Bible JOKE is a spin from people who added their perspective...their are NO TRACEABLE ORIGINAL WORDS OF GOD IN WRITING BY MUHAMMAD...and talk about HORRIFICALLY OBSOLETE DOGMA  \\r\\nwho does it better than the early Roman Catholic Church...the KORAN is as insane as the Old Testament with HOW a BELIEVER MUST EXIST and OBEY as it is written....  \\n  \\r\\nWhere is GOD in all this stupidity of DEATH and DESTRUCTION...the JEW is not ranting on the world stage about their GOD  \\n  \\r\\nThe Christian and Muslim want to assimilate all humanity and EXTERMINATE the JEW issue.....just ask your ISRAEL Neighbors in the Middle East....all of it os so OBSOLETE and unnecessary for a HEALTHY existence...  \\n  \\r\\nAs mentioned Buddhist...Krishna....+++ do not obsess on ruling humanity with retarded DOGMA...that requires PUNISHMENT and SUFFERING by the hands of others....  \\n  \\r\\nThe Middle East JEW also worshipped many GODS and DEITIES before implementing a 1 GOD ONLY construct...  \\n  \\r\\nIf the GOD/SPIRITUAL pursuit does not FORCE or HARM but inspires and encourages OPEN MINDED thinking and LIVING without the FEAR-INTIMIDATION-VIOLENCE fused into the Gogma/ideology...then like Buddhism...so what ...do as you see fit for your well being...  \\n  \\r\\nThe JESUS and ALLAH assimilation for power and control is a GAME of THRONES tactic...the JESUS side is totally fractured..  \\r\\nanything GOES to assimilate sheeple..just look at Jim Bakker..Jimmy Swaggart...Benny Hinn..with Rock Concert style gatherings for PROFIT...  \\n  \\r\\nAnd the ALLAH assimilation GAME is BY THE BOOK..all who do not OBEY are subject to execution-torture-+++ like a CONCENTRATION CAMP...in the name of their GOD... if ALLAH takes over ISRAEL would be leveled..all technology would be trashed..and the coast line would be a TENT CITY ...of LUNATICS praying 5 times a day...and wanting to do the same to the whole of humanity...  \\n  \\r\\nBible-GOD-Religion ? who cares....if you do then drown in it....NEVER HARM OVER ANY OF IT...this makes the GOD nothing more than a pathetic scapegoat for POWER and CONTROL...  \\n  \\r\\nAll the GODS of past Civilizations...relegated to MYTHOLOGY...not so with the Middle east 3 that are trending...and the others in INDIA-CHINA-++ what of their GODS ? both were ATTACKED by the MUSLIM over the ages..not the JEW...  \\n  \\r\\nThis insanity must be NEUTRALIZED....thankfully the new generations are aware and not falling for the stagecraft it is so so  \\r\\nHORRIFICALLY OBSOLETE....and DANGEROUS...no human EVER needs to be validated by another HUMAN to EXIST....  \\n  \\r\\nand this is what the GOD Dogma allows..the pathetic psychopath human the opportunity to PLAY GOD....  \\n  \\r\\nThe Bible-Koran ? just another Comic Book with HEROES and VILLAINS...MURDER over it ? NO WAY...that is CRIMINAL   \n",

thousands of others announce their departure ?  \\n  \\r\\nNO..when the HUMANS that invented them decided their GOD did not serve their AGENDA...these GODs were shelved...= POWERLESS/USELESS.......  \\n  \\r\\nThis is why no one says...\"in the name of ODIN or ZEUS convert or DIE\" most people would laugh  \\n  \\r\\nGOD ? creator of billions of Galaxies and trillions of worlds...is not capable of announcing itself to all HUMANS..  \\n  \\r\\nJust a select few...and it's so called human creation is so dysfunctional..the only GUARANTEE a human is capable of doing well is the DEATH and DESTRUCTION of its own species using their GOD as a scapegoat..  \\n  \\r\\n...BRILLIANT DESIGN ? an intelligent DESIGN....laugh...for the psychopath, YES  \\n  \\r\\nor is GOD the work of clever HUMANS who design IT according to their need for POWER and CONTROL over other humans = SLAVE SYSTEM.  \\n  \\r\\n..which begins between the EARS...and is spread like an PLAGUE and causes horrific DEATH and DESTRUCTION in its wake....ABSOLUTELY....just ask the Roman church...ISLAM....and the JEWS that ordered Jesus MURDER...all GUILTY...  \\r\\n...................to murder over some GOD any GOD is the work of a PSYCHOPATH...a MURDERER nothing more..................  \\n  \\r\\nThe HUMAN LIFE FORM....is not a JEW...is not a CHRISTIAN...is not a Muslim....  \\n  \\r\\nIt is not what HUMANS attach to it....Doctor..Lawyer..President...+++  \\n  \\r\\n..............a HUMAN LIFE FORM is NOT a LABEL...a LABEL is a HUMAN construct attached to the LIFE FORM...............................  \\n  \\r\\nYOUR JEW GOD..any GOD has nothing to do with the HUMAN LIFE FORM...unless HUMANS are the result of GENETIC ENGINEERING by a highly advanced space faring species...  \\n  \\r\\nSame as humans are doing now with plants and animals.. and eventually humans ...in which the IGNORANT HUMANS of a long gone era where certainly WOWED and easily would attach a GOD status to these beings...  \\n  \\r\\n....YOUR GOD and what YOU have been conditioned to accept and BELIEVE unconditionally is a result of INFORMATION  \\r\\nFUSED into your neural network...IT ..your GOD exists as a HOLOGRAPHIC projection between YOUR EARS....  \\n  \\r\\nSupported by 24/7 conditioning with your Torah/Temple/Rabbi/Rituals ++++ how can YOU not be affected when this is YOUR 24/7 ENVIRONMENT...  \\n  \\r\\nYOU accept this...and YOU can have it...drown in it...AS LONG as OTHERS who could care less are not affected in anyway...the GOD and the DOGMA humans attach to it..is YOURS to do with as YOU PLEASE....  \\n  \\r\\nNot so with The Christian and Muslim MIND and LIFE MOLESTERS...they force assimilation...these are TERRORISTS of the HUMAN LIFE FORM...which cannot have a LABEL attached to it that DEFINES IT...this is pure IGNORANCE...  \\n  \\r\\nThe HUMAN LIFE FORM...body and brain is an amazing alliance that is the most extraordinary and versatile life form on this planet...The BODY is NOT a JEW...or CHRISTIAN...or MUSLIM +++ it is a TOOL...an amazing tool.  \\n  \\r\\nThe BRAIN is not a JEW...or a Christian..or a Muslim...  \\n  \\r\\nIt is so EXTRAORDINARY humans are just barely tapping into the potential of it..and no HUMAN on EARTH truly understands how IT does what it does...this is an exciting frontier...many Ancient civilizations were more advanced than some TODAY...and were destroyed by the insane MUSLIM and CHRISTIAN psychopaths...they MURDER INNOVATION...  \\n  \\r\\nThe Religious PSYCHOPATHS MURDERED the OPEN MIND thought process...with their horrific GOD inventions and the insane DOGMA they attached to their GOD invention....  \\n  \\r\\nWhat has GOD ? any GOD done to enhance the quality of EXISTING on EARTH so all life forms can THRIVE ? .....nothing.....  \\r\\nOnly mentally MOLESTED HUMANS who play GOD DESTROY everything in their wake...  \\n  \\r\\nit is merely a HOLOGRAPHIC projection with information HUMANS attach to it...information 7 billion + HUMANS do not agree upon...  \\n  \\r\\nYOUR GOD between YOUR EARS...OK ..keep it...pray to it...take it to your grave...LEAVE OTHERS to THRIVE without it..  \\n  \\r\\nAS more HUMANS wake up to their individual AWESOMENESS as a unique LIFE FORM...that cannot be defined by some retarded LABEL...especially Religious...  \\n  \\r\\nThen HUMANS reach for the stars and beyond with the OPEN MIND and CURIOSITY that the MURDERERS of these amazing attributes..who so desperately want to reduce them to dumbed down SLAVES of GOD inventing PSYCHOPATHS will leave  \\n  \\r\\nGOD on the shelf with ZEUS and ODIN and FINALLY be FREE to EXPLORE and DISCOVER without FEAR-INTIMIDATION-VIOLENCE.....   \n",

                   \\n  \\r\\nI am going to center my argument in this case on two points, where young people are clueless , and still they are making cogent arguments  \\n  \\r\\nthe fact that I have lost all debates here is actually a dage of honor, becuase the voters here are typically kids who are not voting on logic , but simply emotion  \\n  \\r\\nThe level of attack that I have received is really quite funny to me, and yet it is I wh ohave been reported and order of magnitude higher than anyone else, because only liberals can be offended- conservatives, who are typically older and wiser, have much tougher skins  \\n  \\r\\nHere are my two points  \\n  \\r\\n(1) Science and Engineering  \\n  \\r\\n(2) Politics and History  \\n  \\r\\nIn both of these areas, it is clear that the younger crowd (especially not yet out of high school and in college) are absolutely clueless, or maybe a bit knowlegeable but essetially ignorant, but willing to spout nonsense and try and sound smart  \\n  \\r\\nI know what it is like being young- you think you know everything  \\n  \\r\\nBut let me tell you , you are a TOTALLY different human being after you have gone through your 20s and enter your 30s  \\n  \\r\\nOK  \\n  \\r\\n(1) Science  \\n  \\r\\nI have started at least three or four debates about energy policy, hydrogen, collidal silver and other topics  \\n  \\r\\nI attempted to start a debate with dreaming bearcat, who had repsonded nonsense about nuclear energy, arguing with an 18 year old who didnt have the facts , and she chickened out.  \\n  \\r\\nIn each case, I was trying to debate with kids who have NO CLUE what they are talking about.  \\n  \\r\\nOne supposed engineer (self proclaimed_) started trying to talk about fuel cells and the carnot efficiency, and when I quizzed him on both - he had no idea what they were.  \\n  \\r\\nOne other 22 year old tried to tell me that philosphy was actaully superior to real science and engineering- with a bunch of bloviating nonsense that I simply call mental masutrbation  \\n  \\r\\nWhat this says to me is what I already know, kids these days, and espeically on this site, have not or are not willing to study hard subjects like Chemistry, Physics, and engineering, and become fodder for fools like Al Gore , who come along and tell them the sky is falling.  \\n  \\r\\n(2) Politics and History  \\n  \\r\\nI have started and have been in many debates on the role of religion, on the threat of Islam, on Bush Derangement syndrome, the war and many other subjects  \\n  \\r\\nTypically young folks are fed a bunch of anti-conservative propaganda and buy it hook line and sinker  \\n  \\r\\nThere is no logic in liberalism- it is all feelings  \\n  \\r\\nAnd futhermore there is a unwillingness on the part of young people to try and learn on any subject- they refuse to read the links I send along, dont send any in return, or in the case of one rude young person- send along pornographic references, and think that is funny  \\n  \\r\\nI can go on and on, but I will be wasting my breath since most young people already know it all and are not willing to learn.  \\n  \\r\\n(especially liberals)  \\n

                                                                                                                                                                \\n  \\r\\nI did ask for cogent arguments, and thus far you are disappointing. Although, I'll to the effort to point out your mistakes there in.  \\n  \\r\\nI contend that, as a 1996 study found, the ability to understand and perceive incompetence are exactly the skills lacking in the incompetent. I thusly gauge that your ability to declare people clueless may be impaired if you are yourself clueless. To accuse people, myself included, of voting against you on the grounds that they are kids not voting on logic is not a cogent argument. I submit that your arguments typically descend into rants about Muslims, the ACLU, Liberals and Communists. I contend that the voters, whoever they may be, do not view these as cogent arguments on topics ranging from hydrogen economies to the importance of the Bible. I contend that you have been shooting yourself in the foot rather than suffering from a grand conspiracy of teenagers out to get you.  \\n  \\r\\nYou argue that conservatives have tougher skins due to being older and wiser. I submit that many old conservatives go into hissy fits when told \"happy holidays\". I contend that this is not thick skin but rather the product of living in a culture where offensive material to older, white, Christian, conservatives has been largely removed from the public square.  \\n  \\r\\nYou stake your claim on two points, which quite honestly are four points: Science, engineering, history, and politics. I contend that youth in these topics is generally an advantage. For example, studies have found that that the peak years for discovery are between 18-25, after which most people become less productive. For example, Albert Einstein published three papers, proving atomism, laying the groundwork for quantum mechanics, and general relativity all in his early twenties. As he aged he never managed any breakthroughs of equal note.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have had debate on science topics. I have read these debates and found them wanting. First off, hydrogen is not a very effective alternative fuel for gasoline, you lost the debate that it was... two somebody in his forties with bad arguments himself. You were crushed on the topic of collidal silver because it's unscientific hogwash. It will perhaps turn you blue but it has never been shown to cure anything. You were demolished by a 19 year old whose argument was not only correct by scientifically justified showing an understanding of not only viral anatomy and and the immune system but the working of the FDA when it comes to nonsense.  \\n  \\r\\nHowever, we should be very careful here and note that the very essence of the argument is that young people are inherently inferior. A few people who schooled you in a debate and you claim to have won and that they were idiots, does not count as evidence of this universal claim. Just as having a white cat would not justify my claim that all cats are white.  \\n  \\r\\nAl Gore does not say the sky is falling, he says that global warming is real and the science is very much on his side.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have had a number of rants about Islam being a threat. This may be the case, however your case is poorly made on the subject. And you have thusly lost every issue. Nothing you have said here has any bearing on that.  \\n  \\r\\nYoung people are not fed anti-conservative propaganda they usually make decisions for themselves and understanding the issues and the morality at play choose to go against the conservative propaganda which typically tends towards incoherent rants.  \\n  \\r\\nLiberalism is has a good amount of logic behind a good number of ideas. And though people have feelings towards their positions that is not to be confused with people basing their position on feelings. Further, I contend, a good deal of conservative policies are fueled by hate and fear; last I checked those were emotions.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have made a number of points about your previous debates (typically incorrect points) and a number of points about liberalism. You have however made no argument as to how your pathetic performance in prior debates shows youths to be incompetent nor have you shown that the arguments for liberalism are incorrect or proved the impossibility that young people can be non-liberal. Which, if one is to argue that all liberals are wrong and all youths are liberals needs to be established.  \\n  \\r\\nFirst round: 0 cogent arguments. 1 offtopic rant.   \n",

       "508392  [at some point the jews backed off the old testament enforcement of how to exist the jew does not assimilate others using fear intimidation violence the old testament is a psychotic blood bath the jew would be totally exterminated if they tried the assimilation of humanity game using the old testament as it is written literally nor so with the jesus and allah slavers the roman church went on a rampage of death and destruction in collusion with powers of the time the jew tooka back seat and stayed under the radar still they were persecuted relentlessly years after the jesus invention muhammad has a similar meetup with a god like moses , he was illiterate and his followers came up with the koran which like the christian bible joke is a spin from people who added their perspective their are no traceable original words of god in writing by muhammad and talk about horrifically obsolete dogma who does it better than the early roman catholic church the koran is as insane as the old testament with how a believer must exist and obey as it is written where is god in all this stupidity of death and destruction the jew is not ranting on the world stage about their god the christian and muslim want to assimilate all humanity and exterminate the jew issue just ask your israel neighbors in the middle east all of it os so obsolete and unnecessary for a healthy existence as mentioned buddhist krishna do not obsess on ruling humanity with retarded dogma that requires punishment and suffering by the hands of others the middle east jew also worshipped many gods and deities before implementing a god only construct if the god spiritual pursuit does not force or harm but inspires and encourages open minded thinking and living without the fear intimidation violence fused into the gogma ideology then like buddhism so what do as you see fit for your well being the jesus and allah assimilation for power and control is a game of thrones tactic the jesus side is totally fractured anything goes to assimilate sheeple just look at jim bakker jimmy swaggart benny hinn with rock concert style gatherings for profit and the allah assimilation game is by the book all who do not obey are subject to execution torture like a concentration camp in the name of their god if allah takes over israel would be leveled all technology would be trashed and the coast

Ste93 provided an alternative definition... to which there was absolutely no outcome. But that is besides the point.  \\n  \\r\\nThe reason I have an \"observation\" section is to point out how quickly abusive this debate has become. What started as the claim \"It was celebrated by many Muslims as a great victory because they believe that the terrorists are going to paradise and they will be joining them too.\" [1] (currently page 3 of the comments) When asked to defend this claim, he threw random verses of the Qura'an out in the comments section without having a clue as to their context, but then accepted the debate. I was reluctant to challenge him expecting to have to respond to 8000 characters' worth of mistranslated and contextually-skewed verses. Instead, I got something worse. Ste93 has chosen to limit the scope of the debate ONLY to the extremist interpretations of the Qura'an that are condemned by every Muslim scholar on the planet. To quote Ste93 from this debate in particular:  \\n  \\r\\n\"Firstly, I do not claim that all Muslims celebrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but some undoubtedly did.\"  \\n  \\r\\n\"Now, of course not all Muslims take a literal interpretation of the Koran (for which we should be grateful), but you can't deny that some people do. Even if it is a minority, some people read passages like these and can then justify terrorism.\"  \\n  \\r\\n\"I do not think the 9/11 terrorists were inherently evil people (like Hitler and Stalin were); they genuinely believed that they were doing good in the name of Allah.\"  \\n  \\r\\nWhat I now have to defend is the terrorist ideology as a result of my opponent, which I refuse to do. Instead, we will respond to the claims made to prove that the verses demonstrated are NOT violent, and that all terrorist interpretations are simply misunderstandings of an otherwise perfect revelation.  \\n  \\r\\no Arguments  \\n  \\r\\nFaith is supposedly the inspiration for Muslim terrorism. When we look to the quotes my opponent has brought, we can analyze them one at a time and see how fallacious it is to simply quote the most complex book in the world.  \\n  \\r\\n\"And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allah, and for those weak, illtreated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.\"\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'm guessing my opponent didn't even read this verse? It says, in other words, \"You all must defend the oppressed people who ask for God's mercy.\" Literally; look at the verse. \"...what is WRONG with you that you FIGHT NOT... FOR THOSE WEAK, ILLTREATED AND OPPRESSED... whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from... OPPRESSORS\" (capitalization for emphasis, as I cannot bold).  \\n  \\r\\nNext, my opponent cites hadith. \"I have been ordered to fight with the people till they say, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah.\" I have now learned that even Hadith is taken out of context; I thought it was just the Qura'an people defame in contextually skewed grounds. Here is the whole Hadith my opponent cited.  \\n  \\r\\n\"Narrated Abu Huraira: When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, 'Umar said, \"O Abu Bakr! How can you fight these people although Allah's Apostle said, 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, 'and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me, unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account will be with Allah?' \"Abu Bakr said, \"By Allah! I will fight whoever differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Allah's Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Allah's Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it.\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.\"\" [2]  \\n  \\r\\nThis situation is referring to (as stated in the first line) after the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) died, a number of people became apostates and left Islam. The conversation between Abu Bakr and Umar, both Caliphs, referred to how they should be dealt with. To those who do not know, back in the day the government was not separate from religion. So, leaving the religion is equivalent to leaving the government; in other words, treason. Treason, I hope my opponent would agree, is punishable. The problem is that this Hadith is not longer temporally relevant because we don't have a government that is connected with the religion.  \\n  \\r\\nThe final quote my opponent provides is \"Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His cause in ranks, as if they were a solid structure.\" It is well explained here [3] Basically, it is one of the many ways in which we can fight for Allah's cause through \"jihad\". I'm reluctant to use this term, but I will explain it. Jihad means struggle, if I say (in Arabic) \"ana am ijtahid\" it means \"I am struggling\". There are several types of jihad, which are sometimes used in English literature to describe the plot type. Man vs. himself, Man vs. Man, etc. In this case, what we see Allah asking us to do is to unite as one in our jihad; to struggle for him, and to defend Islam as the \"umma\" we are all united under. I hope I have explained this well enough; if not, I will try to do so more extensively in the next round.  \\n  \\r\\nAs regarding everything else my opponent refers to; let me define martyrdom. It is \"death that is imposed because of the person's adherence of a religious faith or cause\". [4] Let us not confuse this; in Islam, those who are \"sha'hed\" are martyrs, and they are people who died in DEFENSE of Islam or their nation. Succinctly, to be a praised martyr in Islam is to die in defense of your nation, not in an offensive terrorist plot.  \\n  \\r\\no Conclusion  \\n  \\r\\nWhat we are left with is really little hope at a con ballot, pro being the only way to go for the following reasons.  \\n  \\r\\n1) The terrorist ideology is a false interpretation.  \\r\\n2) Martyrdom is not equivalent to terrorism.  \\r\\n3) Contextual skew and misinterpretation does not justify extremism.  \\n  \\r\\nMy opponent has failed to uphold the burden of proof initially placed upon him, so we're left with one more round in which we can hope that this is done. With that, I'll hand the debate over to con and remind him that, as many verses as he cites, I can justify. Quoting the Qura'an hundreds of times fallaciously does not amount to an argument.  \\n  \\r\\nAlso, I thank the readers for their time.  \\n  \\r\\no Sources  \\n  \\r\\n[1]   http://www.debate.org...  \\n  \\r\\n[2]   http://www.muslimway.org...  \\n  \\r\\n[3]   http://www.islamonline.net...  \\n  \\r\\n[4]   http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu...</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nThank you for your response.  \\n  \\r\\nSince the debate has become extremely bland, I'm just going to respond to my opponent's criticisms, as there is nothing much left for me to do.  \\n  \\r\\n\"My opponent has suggested different meanings to the passages I quoted and stated that some of them were taken out of context. But what does it matter? You personally may interpret things this way, but that doesn't mean every Muslim should or indeed every non-Muslim. ***These passages could be taken as meaning kill people.*** If Allah condemned this type of behaviour so much, he would not have made his book so ambiguous and subject to pretty much any interpretation.\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'd like to focus our attention on the sentence between stars. My opponent is absolutely wrong; no where does the Qura'an mean to kill people at any one point. To have such a ridiculous interpretation, one must deliberately abuse the teachings of the Qura'an by taking verses out of context or mistranslating them to come up with what is modern-day terrorism. As an example, there is a verse that is commonly cited that says \"slay the non-believers wherever you find them,\" or something along those lines. The problem is, this verse comes from a historical event- the \"non-believers\" in that passage is very specifically referring to the hostile family of pagan Mecca, the time period during which Muhammad was receiving revelation. Is a nation supposed to recite verses to a violent and armed Godless people like the Meccans were, who literally had a price on Muhammad's head? No, they would fight back, and I hope my opponent would agree.  \\n  \\r\\n\"It is a fact that 19 Muslims committed the 9/11 attrocity. I ask my opponent then to offer  \\r\\nan explanation as to why they would do this. Also, if Islam did not exist, do you think the twin towers would still be standing.\"  \\n  \\r\\nFirst, the 9-11 conspiracy theory leaves us all dubious as to whether or not the above is a fact [1]. I hope my opponent has heard of it. Even if it was the 19 \"Muslims\" my opponent claims it was, like I said, they aren't Muslims, and they don't follow Islamic doctrine or the teachings of the Qura'an. They are violence loving extremists who are militantly mobilized; they kill other Muslims, how does that make ANY sense? Because they're NOT Muslims.  \\n  \\r\\n\"It is also a fact that many Muslims reacted violently when a cartoon depicting Muhammad was published in a Danish newspaper. Is this not a sign of intolerance?\"  \\n  \\r\\nThis is false. It seems my opponent didn't read enough about the event, but here is the truth behind it [2]. As a tl;dr: there is a group known as 'RevolutionMuslim' who claimed to be the violent outcry of Muslims when, in fact, not one Muslim really even cared about SouthPark's cartoon or the Danish newspaper. Meanwhile, this group was run by 2 'Muslims'; in fact, they were 2 zionist Jews pretending to be Muslim who smeared the name of Islam in America, and quite successfully if I may say so myself. At the end of the day, though, my opponent's claims are false. Islam is actually the most tolerant religion in the world that claims \"Let there be no compulsion in religion.\" (Qur'an 2:256), read more about it here [3].  \\n  \\r\\n\"Also, are Al Quaeda muslims or not?\"  \\n  \\r\\nNo.  \\n  \\r\\n\"In Christianity, there are people even U.S. congressmen) who would consider a major terrorist attack, or perhaps a major natural disaster, as a god thing, as it suggests the second coming of Christ (it does not take much thought to realise how conter-productive and dangerous such an attitude can be). Similarly there were Muslims that celebrated the 9/11 attacks. Al Quaeda for a start.\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'm not sure anything mattered up until the last two sentences. My opponent claims Muslims celebrated 9-11, but has provided no evidence. Anyways, for the celebrations I found these articles to more accurately depict the situation [4] [5]. To summarize what's in the articles, \"Muslims\" who celebrated were the more extreme, but the large majority of the Islamic world was very sympathetic and condemned the attack.  \\n  \\r\\n\"My opponent (rather defensively) seems to be suggesting that Islam could never be a cause for evil in the world. I'm afraid history would disagree. Would the world be a better place if people weren't tied to ancient scriptures and dogma? I think so, it'll be interesting t see how my opponent may argue against this.\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'm afraid history would disagree with my opponent. The crusades, initiated by the crumbling Byzantines, brought Western Europe over to Jerusalem to reconquer it violently from the Muslims. The tale tells that the city was knee-high in blood; the women were raped, then killed along with the children and elderly. Meanwhile, when the Muslim tactician and skilled army general known as Saladin took his position at the age of 20, he reconquered Jerusalem. He is renowned for his benevolence and tolerance [6]. Here is an important passage from the article.  \\n  \\r\\n//In return for an attack made by the Crusaders of the Kerak on Muslim pilgrims in 1187, Saladin moved his army to northern Palestine and defeated the much larger Crusader army in the decisive battle of Hettin (July 4, 1187). Three months after this battle, Saladin captured Jerusalem. Unlike the Christians 88 years earlier, who made Jerusalem a bloodbath, Saladin did not loot, murder or seek revenge for the Muslims. He spared the lives of 100,000 Christians and allowed Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem after its fall. In this benevolent act, Saladin was simply emulating Prophet Muhammad as the Prophet reentered his birth-city of Mecca. When Muhammad returned to Mecca with ten thousand people, he entered it without any bloodshed. He told its people with his famous words: \"Go about (wherever you please), for you are set free.\"//  \\n  \\r\\nMy opponent has insufficiently upheld his burden.

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  Pro has to either offer characteristics of the Syrian government that make it better than the FSA, or some reasonable benefits we can only have if Assad remained ruling. He has not done this so far.  What he offered was an unsupported (possibly fabricated) survey stating that Bashar has more support than the FSA. After I traced Pro's source and its sources, I was astonished by the details which lead me to the conclusion that this all was highly likely to be a fabrication,  1- Pro contradicts his own sources when he says the survey was \"done by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly known as NATO).\" According to his source, the survery data   was only relayed   to the NATO.  2- [From the original source of the survery, World Tribune]  \"The sources said   no formal polling was taken in Syria  ...   They said   the   data came from a range of activists and independent organizations   that   were working in Syria, particularly in relief efforts.\"  So basically, the original source of the survery claims that \"the sources\" say that the polling was not formal, and that the data came from a range of unidentified activists and organizations, not a survey group. No numbers, no names, no citations, no details about the survey—nothing. Just a blog referring to another without any actual tenable data.  3- Not reported by mainstream media, n  o mention of this report by NATO (I even tried searching library databases)  , actual NATO Data(if any exists) absent from the sources of the articles that mention it.   I can conclude that this is just a fabrication that is not supported by any tenable evidence  My Argument  :  A- Disadvantages of Bashar Al-Assad continuing his presidency  1- Loss of economic and diplomatic ties between Syria and most of the countries in the world. This is namely because of the Syrian regime's human-rights abuses and the boycott of Bashar Al-Assad around the world.  2- The continuation of the economic sanctions on Syria on the basis that it is an inhumane dictatorship.  3- Many Syrian refugees would live under wretched conditions in Lebanon and other countries, given that they are mostly Sunnah who avoided the genocides in Syria(some of them are even wives and children of FSA members).  4- The conflict between Syria's neighbour Turkey and Bashar Al-Assad, which puts Syria in another peril, given that Turkey supports the FSA and is against Assad's human-rights abuses. This means that if Bashar stayed in power, we might witness a war that would have harsh consequences on Syria.  A1- Loss of economic and diplomatic ties between Syria and most of the countries in the world.  Because of the inhumane practices of the Syrian government, it has lost many of its diplomatic relations with previous allies such as: Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, United States, Belgium, Spain, and the Gulf States[1]. It even has been excommunicated from the Arab League in 2011 and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in 2012. This, of course, has negative effects on Syria's economy, because many of those states refuse to engage in any economic relations until Assad is overthrown. That clarified, Syria's economy is in a deplorable state and it needs all the help it can get from the rest of the world, provided that the Iranian support is not enough to keep the economy standing on its two feet. For instance, the Syrian government’s reserves decreased from $18 billion to $2 billion because of the conflict, according to a report released by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research in January 2013. According to that same report, $48 billion is currently required for the reconstruction of Syria with a predicted amount at $60-200 billion if the conflict continued. This all occurred even with a financial support from Iran, which means that Syria needs the support of Eastern and Western states which have boycotted the government because of Assad.  [1]   http://www.haaretz.com...  ...  A2- The continuation of economic sanctions on Syria.  The economic sanctions had dreadful consequences on the Syrian Oil Production. For instance, the Syrian regime is unable to find buyers for around 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day, which forces the Syrian state treasury to loose about $5 billion dollars a year[2]. Moreover, the Arab League Economic Committee opposed Bashar Al-Assad by suspending flights from member states to Syria, ending transactions with the Syrian central bank and freezing all Syrian assets in Arab countries[3]. Syria is already in a deplorable state due to the accumulated effects of the civil war, so the removal of Bashar Al-Assad would remove those sanctions and help in enhancing the economic state.  [2]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  ...  [3]   http://www.aljazeera.com...  ...  A3- Many Syrian immigrants would remain to live as refugees under wretched conditions.  The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon alone is approximated to be 1.2 million[4]. This great influx of refugees is namely because of Sunnah escaping violence and oppression from the Alawite minority, and as the Syrian National TV and Pro-Assad media stated, the fact that the FSA members are sending their families to Lebanon to protect them from the Syrian regime[5]. If Assad continued to rule, there is no guarantee that those refugees would be allowed to return to their lands, which are mostly lands that have been destroyed and could be easily conquered by Alawite residents, who are already against the wide expansion of the Sunnah in Syria. Assad, in my opinion, would prefer them not to come back because of their infamous support of the FSA and the fact that they are mostly Sunnah; thus, a source of opposition to his regime.   [4]   http://www.yalibnan.com...  ...  [5]   http://english.al-akhbar.com...  ...  A4- The conflict between Syria's neighbour Turkey and Bashar Al-Assad.  The Syrian national army is not in a position to fight against a nation like Turkey, and Syria had enough bombings and battles. Provided that Bashar is despised by Turkey, it is advisable to remove him to restore diplomatic and economic ties between those two countries, at least to ensure that a conflict is not even possible. There many reasons to believe that such a war is possible. For example, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan announced in October 5 2012 \"We are not interested in war, but we're not far from it either,\" after the incident in October 3 when Turkish troops attacked Syria[6].   [6]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  ...  B- Advantages of having the FSA  B1- Financial support from many rich countries  Qatar and KSA have supported many Arab nations in critical situations such as Lebanon, and they are accused of financially supporting the FSA[7]. Hence, it is guaranteed that they would donate billions of dollars to help reconstruct Syria and support the FSA's leadership. Moreover, the majority of countries who opposed Assad are also expected to give out money for humanitarian purposes, which means that Syria's economy is better off with that financial support.  [7] rt.com/news/arming-syria-rebels-saudi-913/  B2- Democracy and political life in Syria  Assad wants to re-establish a dictatorship, while the rebels are seeking a democracy. Some of them want it based on Islamic principles and others on secular ones, but that at least creates a diversity and many political parties, instead of the traditional solo party that governs Syria.  B3- Return of thinkers and activists who were shunned by the Syrian government  There are many thinkers who were shunned from Syria after years of persecution and censorship, and have been working with the rebels from abroad even with some objections to some of their violent acts. I'm going to list a few. Syrian lawyer and human rights activist Razan Zaitouneh(2012 Ibn Rushd Award winner), and Syrian author Samar Yazbek(Pen Pinter literary prize winner)[8]. They are expected to return and help reform the rebels if Assad is overthrown, given that his regime is the reason for their exile.

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  I was expecting my opponent's rebuttal in this round. Anyhow, I'm going to provide my rebuttal as I promised in the earlier round.  A- Can Bashar Al-Assad really stop the armed clashes and the civil disorders?  This seems to be a main assumption in my opponent's argument, even though it is unrealistic due to many reasons:  1- The frail state of the Syrian national army which is now relying on Hezbollah to fight its battles[1].   2- The nature of the FSA's resistance, which is basically coming from \"beehive\" military factions of a persecuted majority in Syria[2].   3- The presence of foreign soldiers in the FSA that pass the wide Syrian borders, and who are backed by many rich nations in the Arab world. This point was also listed by my opponent, and it ensures the presence of a continuous and well-funded resistance against the Syrian regime[3].  [1]   http://www.reuters.com...  [2]   http://www.mcclatchydc.com...  [3]   http://online.wsj.com...  B- Brief critique of my opponent's main points.  B1- \"The FSA is not well-defined nor do they have control or any responsibility over their actions.\"   Even if the FSA were as disorganized, chaotic and dispersed as my opponent claims, this does not necessarily mean that they would always stay like that. Take as an example Hezbollah which started as a set of disorganized and \"not well-defined\" factions in south Lebanon, and after the retreat of Israel, changed into one of the most organized and powerful militias in the world[4].  [4]   http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com...  B2- \"The various factions will not be able to unify. As said before, these factions are already claiming territory and not allowing certain factions to pass.\"   According to their own definition, they are not a military that holds territory but one that seeks to spread the Syrian army in all Syria so that it weakens its defences[5]. Even though they are dispersed because of this strategy, they fight for the same goal and help each other with weapons, artillery, shelter, food and military operations[6]. The talk about their dispersion is exaggerated and inaccurate.   [5]   http://www.mcclatchydc.com...  [6]   http://www.thenational.ae...  B3- \"The only reason the U.S. wishes to aid the rebels in an attempt to destabilize the Middle-east.\"   This is a non-sequitur. Even if it was true, it doesn't work as a reason for why the FSA cannot rule. The US, and if truly wanted destabilization, would ensure that Assad stays ruling while the FSA continues fighting him, which contradicts putting the FSA in power.  B4- \"Many, at least a large minority, of the rebels are mercenaries, some foreign backed. And many more of them are Islamist fundamentalist Jihadist.\"   My opponent has to explain why a majority of \"Islamist fundamentalist Jihadist\" would oppose a Jihad call from Lebanese Salafees[7]. It is clear that the majority of the FSA are moderate Muslims, who identify themselves separately from Jabhat Al-Nusrah because of their dismissal of radical Islam. As an FSA spokesman in Aleppo said, the FSA doesn't share the beliefs of Jabhat Al-Nusrah, but they are fighting the same enemy together[8]. Needless to say, the Pro-Syrian forces are using Hezbollah, a mercenary of Jihadists, and newly-trained Shite jihadists on their side. Hence, a mirrored situation exists even if my opponent's accusation was true.  [7]   http://www.naharnet.com...  [8]   http://www.usatoday.com...  B5- \"The FSA and the various rebel-factions will not be able to form a coercive government.\"  It would be effective to state this reason, if Bashar could actually control Syria as he did before. But this is clearly not the case, given the Syrian government lost its power in many parts of Syria. Therefore, it is pointless to use this as a reason for why the FSA should not rule, when Bashar Al-Assad has lost his tight grip on the Syrian nation, and cannot form a coercive government due to all the changes.  B6- \"If Assad is knocked out of power or if the rebels are not exterminated then the country will be thrown into eternal conflict and, eventually, forgotten by the media and the public, as always.\"  I wouldn't say \"eternal,\" but definitely long-lasting, and this is currently the situation in Syria even with Assad present. The proxy war is continuing in both scenarios, which means that this claim is ignoring the mirrored situation which won't be that different in this regard.  C- Rebuttal of specific claims in my opponent's argument  Contention 1: \"But the rebels have indeed seized a Saudi-owned chemical plant and has obviously used it against innocent civilians in an attempt to pin the blame on the government.\"  According to my opponent's citation, this was done by Jabhat al-Nusra, not the FSA. And I agreed to debate based on the condition that those should be treated as two different groups. Here is the citation: \"On 8 December, it was reported that members of the jihadist Al-Nusra Front had recently captured a Saudi-owned toxic chemicals plant outside of Aleppo.\" In addition to that, the citation does not say that chemical bombs from this plant were used against innocent civilians. This is a baseless claim.  It is true that there is no proof yet on who is behind the chemical bombings, but there is good evidence that the Syrian government is behind it:  1- \"Zahir al-Sakit, a former Syrian army general from the chemical weapons branch, said he was instructed to use chemical weapons during a battle with the FSA in the southwestern area of Hauran. But instead, Sakit disobeyed the orders and swapped the chemicals with disinfectant water he called \"Javel water.\"[9]  2- \"An 23 April 2013 the New York Times reported that the British and French governments had sent a confidential letter to the United Nations Secretary General, claiming that there was evidence that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in Aleppo, Homs, and perhaps Damascus.\"[10]  3- \"By 25 April the U.S intelligence assessment was that the Assad regime had likely used chemical weapons – specifically sarin gas.\"[11]  4- \"After clandestinely spending two months in Jobar, Damascus, several reporters for the French news media Le Monde personally witnessed the Syrian army's use of chemical weapons on civilians.\" [12,13]  [9]   http://english.alarabiya.net...  [10]   http://www.nytimes.com...  [11]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  [12]   http://www.lemonde.fr...  [13]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  Contention 2: \"FSA is quite ruthless, as are other rebel factions. If they approach a male civilian who is fit for or not aiding their general cause, due to black and white thinking, in their eyes if you aren't for them then you're against them.\"  This is an outrageous generalization stated without any evidence, although it claims that it describes a dominant behaviour among the FSA members. BoP on my opponent.  Contention 3: \"I have seen dozens of videos of innocent men who have been accused of working for Assad by the FSA and executed, all the while the innocent men pleaded...\"  This won't pass here that easily. We need proof that those men were actually innocent.</td>\n",

In order to assume this, he must overlook the countless violent verses in the koran, beheadings, honor killings, wife beating, and the affects of the religion. First and foremost, The major difference between Christianity and Islam is its real world implications. Islam repeatedly claims to be a \"religion of peace\" this claim however, is easily refuted by a quick glance into the advent of Islam and its modern state all the way back to the caliphate.  \\n  \\r\\n1. Most Muslim countries are failed states while primarily Christian nations are wealthy and prosperous  \\n  \\r\\n2. Islam currently has the most extremists of any religion with hundreds of Islamic terrorist groups killing innocent civilians every day in the name of Allah. While it is true that Christian terrorist groups exist, they are very small compared to their muslim counterparts and their acts of terror are much less severe and find little to no backing from the Bible.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Several hundred Christian charities exist for non Christians and they provide aid and relief for displaced muslims while Islam does not operate nearly any charities for international aid. Christian Aid workers are also often at risk for kidnapping from islamic terrorists for helping in those countries  \\n  \\r\\n4. When Christians live in Muslim countries, they are constantly persecuted and are denied churches and houses of worship. When Muslims come to Christian countries, they are accepted as useful members of society and are allowed to gather and build mosques freely.  \\n  \\r\\n5. Christians in Muslim countries are killed for peacefully expressing their desire for equality. Muslims in Christian countries violently protest and demand that the government and schools change to fit their needs, claiming racism whenever they are criticized for their behavior.  \\n  \\r\\n6. Sharia law is considered higher than constitutional law in almost all Muslim countries. Sharia law promotes oppression, veiling of women, mandatory beards, religious police and a tax for non muslims. Christianity has no concept of religious law and separates church and state. with the exception of canon law, which only applies to clergy and is much less restricting than sharia.  \\n  \\r\\nthere are also several differences between the patrons of Islam (Muhammed) and Christianity (Jesus Christ).  \\n  \\r\\n1. Muhammed was a bandit and a warrior while Jesus was a preacher and a carpenter  \\n  \\r\\n2. Muhammed preached violence and demanded bodyguards while Jesus preached peace and chastised anyone who attempted to defend him with force  \\n  \\r\\n3. Muhammed took 12 wives and claimed revelations from god to justify his sex harems and polygamy. Jesus was celibate and never looked upon a woman in a lustful way  \\n  \\r\\n4. Muhammed married a 9 year old girl, fondled her and BATHED with her. Jesus ... well... didn't do that.  \\n  \\r\\n5. Muhammed spread his message through hate and war, killing anyone who wouldn't convert and taxing non muslims. Jesus spread his message through peace and baptism, using the gospel to bring people to god.  \\n  \\r\\n6. Early Muslims persecuted and killed non Muslims. Early Christians lived in constant persecution from non christians  \\n  \\r\\n7. Jesus was said to do many miracles, with several eye witnesses bearing testament to his divinity while Muhammed was never able to do one miraculous thing in his life.  \\n  \\r\\n8. Muhammed: Demanded others die for him  \\r\\nJesus: Suffered one of the most agonizing deaths for the sake of Humanity.  \\n  \\r\\n9. Jesus = most praised spiritual leader. Muhammed = most criticized spiritual leader.  \\n  \\r\\nViolent Verses in the Koran  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (2:191-193) - \"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out.

And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)\"  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (3:151) \"Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority\". (This verse speaks directly of trinitarian christians, who Muhammad wrongfully believed to be polytheists)  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (8:12) - \"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them\" (no reasonable person can interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle)  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (17:16) - \"And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.\"  \\n  \\r\\nIf I included all violent passages of the Koran in this argument, I would not have enough space. Now with all this in mind, We can see how Islamic terrorists can find justification for such terrible acts. The simple truth is that the Koran not only condones violence, but encourages it and claims that jihadis will have twice the reward in heaven as the peaceful muslims.  \\n  \\r\\nAnother point to consider is the advent of Islam vs the advent of Christianity. Christianity began in 33 AD after Jesus of Nazerath (or Isa Ibn Maryam) was crucified in Jerusalem. After the 12 apostles of Jesus started the religion in the upper room of Mark's house, the Roman Government didn't skip a beat in banning it and killing any christians they found. The christians, instead of taking up arms to defend themselves (which would have been justifiable) chose to follow the teachings of Jesus and turn the other cheek. Christians lived in constant fear of death until Emperor Constantine legalized Christianty in the 3rd century. At this point, Christianity had spread to all corners of the world through peaceful preaching and missionary work.  \\n  \\r\\nThe beginnings of Islam, however were extremely different and much more bloody than Christianity. Muhammed was born in Mecca to a pagan family in 570 C.E. There are debates as to whether he was a Merchant or a bandit but historical sources point to merchant as his likely occupation. In his mid 20s he married a wealthy widow named Khadija. Soon after this, he began to see visions in a cave which he believed to be \"from God\" but in reality, were likely hallucinations caused by dehydration and heat stroke. After his \"revalation\" of Islam, Muhammed began to preach in the Kabba, a pagan worship center with the arabian gods encircling it. After city authorities realized this, Muhammed was forced to emigrate to Medina where he received a much warmer welcome. In Medina, he gathered an army and told his followers that it was their sacred duty to spread Islam, starting with Mecca. Only a few years after the advent of the Religion, Islam began to spread by force, capturing Medina and executing 800 jews in a single day. After the land of Arabia was conquered and forcefully converted by muslim armies. The religion of peace exploded across the borders into Egypt, Turkey, Asia and parts of Europe. This expansion persisted until the retaliatory crusades of Christians managed to stop the spread.  \\n  \\r\\nEarly Christians used the gospel and preaching to convert  \\r\\nEarly Muslims used force to convert  \\n  \\r\\nI anxiously await my Opponents response to these points</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nTo start, I am ignoring all that you quote from the Hadith, since anything that contradicts the Qur'an is false by default. Also, ibn Ishaq's biography was not written from empirical data, but only from oral accounts, so I will ignore that as well. Why? First, I said to use the Qur'an only. That was a ground rule! Second, it's hearsay, so it doesn't prove anything. Lastly, you know that Muhammad wouldn't go against the Qur'an, so you must respect the ground rules of this debate and try to show that the Qur'an itself supposedly commanded him to do the heinous things you've listed.  \\n  \\r\\n1) \"this will be the easiest debate yet\"  \\n  \\r\\nDon't count your chickens before they hatch.  \\n  \\r\\n2) \"Do you worship him?\"  \\n  \\r\\nMuslims don't worship prophets.  \\n  \\r\\n3) \"Is he your savior?\"  \\n  \\r\\nNo. And just by your asking me those questions, you're showing an enormous lack of knowledge of my religion. I don't need to answer the next question, since it's premised on my saying \"yes\" to the foregoing.  \\n  \\r\\n4) \"His followers are still doing his bidding today, exactly as he did\"  \\n  \\r\\nGod's followers are doing God's bidding, which is good works. The term \"Muhammad's followers\" is a misnomer and would not refer to true Muslims at all. Strictly speaking, no Muslim *follows* Muhammad, only God.  \\n  \\r\\n5) \"they (the terrorists)are the \"good Muslims\"\"  \\n  \\r\\nFalse. [5:32] \"For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever slays a soul, unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our messengers came to them with clear arguments, but even after that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land.\"  \\n  \\r\\n6) Saudi Quote. Breaking the ground rules again. I don't care what others say, even if they claim to be Muslim scholars. I only care what the Qur'an says.  \\n  \\r\\n7) You quoted verse 5:51 in the Qur'an, which allegedly says: 5:51 (\"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is one of them.\") \"Allies\" is a mistranslation. The word is &lt;'awliyaa'&gt;, which means \"protectors.\" The context is wartime. The enemy are the pagans who are trying to crush the Muslims. The Qur'an was instructing Muslims not to run for the Jews and Christians for protection. They must stand up for themselves against the attacks instead. What would the Torah have instructed to the Israelites on this matter? \"Run to the Persians cuz they'll protect you\"?  \\n  \\r\\n8) Quote: \"Qur'an 2:10 \"As for those who deny Islam...they shall be the fa**ots for the Fire of Hell.\"\"  \\n  \\r\\nI didn't realize you could just make up stuff when trying to quote something! Look up that verse for yourself. It says: \"In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).\" \"They\" in this verse is referring to    which are the pagans who are trying to kill the Muslims.  \\n  \\r\\n9) Quote: \"Qur'an 33:26 \"Allah made the Jews leave their homes by terrorizing them so that you killed some and made many captive. And He made you inherit their lands, their homes, and their wealth. He gave you a country you had not traversed before.\" Once again, you misquoted the Qur'an very badly. The correct quote: \"And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye made captive some.\" This refers to the People of the Book who aid the kaafiruun.  \\n  \\r\\n10) Here's 47:4 in the correct translation. Stop cutting and pasting from prophetofdoom.com. It only destroys your credibility. Qur'an [47:4] \"Now when ye meet in battle those who are kaafiruun, then it is striking at the necks until, when ye have routed them, making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.\"  \\n  \\r\\nThe correct translation speaks for itself. Interesting that the Arabic word \"jihad\" doesn't appear at all in that verse. Anyway, this verse is clearly meant for times of war against those who were seeking to destroy the small community that made up the fledgling religion.  \\n  \\r\\n11) Muhammad's Life. \"According to the Hadith and Qur'an...\" - Breaking the ground rules again. We aren't talking about the Hadith, remember? \"Muhammad and his henchmen plundered their way to power and prosperity.\" - Tell me where it says that in the Qur'an.  \\n  \\r\\n\"The five oldest and most trusted Islamic sources\" - Breaking the ground rules again. But what are these \"five oldest\" sources? Answer that question, despite your having plagiarized this. \"They reveal that he was a thief, a liar, an assassin, a pedophile, a womanizer, a rapist, a mass murderer, a pirate, a warmonger, and a scheming and ruthless politician. It's hardly the character profile of a religious leader.\" - Show me evidence of this in the Qur'an.  \\n  \\r\\nIbn Ashraf was killed because he was gathering for an uprising against Muhammad. He was planning an attack to kill that small community of Muslims. And even so, this is hearsay, someone's interpretation of what happened. No eye-witness ever wrote anything down to suggest that this happened, but if it did, it was wartime. Same goes with the other dude.  \\n  \\r\\n12) What is in the Qur'an. I'll look past the fact that you got this off of &lt;  http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com...   &gt; under the comments section. But since you did plagiarize someone else's writing, you'll have to explain it. Why are the creation accounts \"dimwitted to the point of being delirious?\" You made an accusation with nothing to back it up. And because the Qur'an doesn't exactly tell the same thing as the Bible, does that make it false? How does that have *anything* to do with *anything*? As far as the order of the suwar, that's not the order of the revelation, and it doesn't matter. Each sura has a reason for being there and has a story to say. And can you tell me what that verse is that \"Muslims don't want it translated?\"  \\n  \\r\\nSo far, almost your entire argument has been copy/paste off of the following sites. You should be wise not to do this as it only destroys your credibility.  \\n  \\n  http://groups.google.com...  \\n  http://www.prophetofdoom.net...  \\n  http://www.prophetofdoom.net...  \\n  http://www.prophetofdoom.net...  \\n  http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com...</td>\n",

Those resources being anti-Islamic hate sites. Your abuse will not be entertained, I assure you. Technically, I should only take one more Qur'anic verse since I told you to give me five of the WORST ones you could find so I could educate you about them. But what you are giving me are hardly even questionable. All it takes is to get a correct translation to prove my point.  \\n  \\r\\n1) Ali Sina. You just quoted a bunch of unsupported accusations. They do not merit a response.  \\n  \\r\\n2) Quote: \"you say Craig Winn horribly misinteprets the Qu-ran , but your translations are pretty much the same as his, and you make mountains out of molehills in trying to parse words and make KILL AND ENSLAVE THE JEWS! mean anything but\"  \\n  \\r\\nActually, quite the opposite. I have proved why these verses are there, what the real translations are, the nuances of the Arabic and what that means to the quote, and ultimately, why that certain quote is not sufficient in proving Islam is bad.  \\n  \\r\\n3) Plagiarizing. Quote: \"and you also make much of my quoting other scholars, as if that is some black mark, but this is NOT SCHOOL, and there ARE NO RULES HERE other than the basic no insults etc.\"  \\n  \\r\\nPlagiarizing shows that you cannot come up with arguments on your own. You can take others ideas, but if you plagiarize, especially in the manner in which you have, then you make accusations which you cannot support and, when I pull out the fatal flaws in them, you cannot defend against. Furthermore, your plagiarism is borderline pathological since (1) you cannot stop, and (2) you see no problem in continuing.  \\n  \\r\\n4) Qur'anic quotes.  \\n  \\r\\nAll of the following quotes first state the first part of what you believed the translation to be (I don't have enough room to put the entire quote) and then state the much more precise translation. As an added bonus, the words \"alladhina kafaru\" have been added beside the part of the translation that is referring to those who reject and seek to destroy Islam, and the quotes all refer to wartime. Additionally, the word \"hypocrites\" is not accurately translated. The real word is closer to \"traitor.\" They are basically people who claim to side with the Muslims, then turn their backs and work for the \"kafaru.\" The word it says in the Qur'an is is \"minafiqun.\"  \\n  \\r\\n8:12 \"I shall terrorize the infidels. So wound...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (8:12): \"When thy Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve [alladhina kafaru]. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.\"  \\n  \\r\\n8:57 \"If you gain mastery over them in battle, inflict...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (8:57): \"If thou comest on them [alladhina kafaru] in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.\"  \\n  \\r\\n33:26 \"Allah made the Jews leave their homes...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (33:26): \"And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them [alladhina kafaru] down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye made captive some.\"  \\n  \\r\\n33:36 - You actually list two different passages for this one verse.  \\r\\nFirst: \"It is not fitting for a Muslim man or woman...\"  \\r\\nAnd then: 33:36 \"No Muslim has any choice after Allah...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (33:36): \"And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His messenger have decided an affair (for them), that they should (after that) claim any say in their affair; and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he verily goeth astray in error manifest.\"  \\n  \\r\\nYou cannot argue against God or Muhammad. Big deal. In Christianity, you cannot argue against God or Jesus.  \\n  \\r\\n33:56 \"Allah and His angels shower blessings...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (33:56): \"Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\"  \\n  \\r\\nThere's no problem here. Muslims respect the prophet, we do not worship him.  \\n  \\r\\n33:57 \"Those who speak negatively of Allah and His Apostle shall be cursed.\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (33:57): \"Lo! those who malign Allah and His messenger, Allah hath cursed them in the world and the Hereafter, and hath prepared for them the doom of the disdained.\"  \\n  \\r\\nNothing wrong with cursing those who malign God and Muhammad. Why would any Muslim do that? Why would any Christian do that to Jesus or God?  \\n  \\r\\n33:60 \"Truly, if the Hypocrites stir up sedition...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (33:60-61): \"If the hypocrites [al-munafiqun], and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be your neighbours in it but a little while. Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter.\"  \\n  \\r\\nNot only does it refer to al-munafiqun, but it is also \"if they do not cease.\"  \\n  \\r\\n47:3 \"Little do you remember My warning. How many towns...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (47:3): \"That is because those who disbelieve [alladhina kafaru] follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for mankind.\"  \\n  \\r\\n49:1 \"Believers, be not forward in the presence...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (49:1-3): \"O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another, lest your works be rendered vain while ye perceive not. Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah, those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness. Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward.\"  \\n  \\r\\nWhy would any Muslim want to disrespect the Prophet by raising his voice over his? Why would a Muslim shout at the Prophet? Respect toward the Prophet is required.  \\n  \\r\\n59:2 \"It was Allah who drove the [Jewish] People...\"  \\n  \\r\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Pickthal's translation (59:2): \"He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved [alladhina kafaru] to go forth from their homes unto the first exile. Ye deemed not that they would go forth, while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from Allah. But Allah reached them from a place whereof they recked not, and cast terror in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!\"  \\n  \\r\\nThis is basically saying that they cannot hide from God.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have yet to prove anything, Solarman.

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  DISCLAIMER  Pro did not provide a definition of \"makes more sense\" in his opening statement, although the term is vague and could have many different meanings and criteria. I took that step in my first round and defined \"makes more sense\" and then built my arguments based on that.  More Sensible(makes more sense):   Having or showing more good sense or judgment[1].  It is now clear that Pro is rejecting the importance of good evidence as a necessary basis for good judgment, but simply arguing that his religion personally makes sense to him, while atheism doesn't. His resolution is self-defeating, subjective and untenable as one can use a similar approach and say that \"apples make more sense than oranges, as there are things about apples which I understand and things about oranges which I don't.\"  If Pro wants to debate that resolution, then he should concede this debate and start another one that does explain his definition of \"makes more sense\" from Round 1.  Pro argues,   \"No it is not sensible to not believe in something when you don't have a good reason not too... if somebody knocked on the door, and you came to open it and you find nobody, and you ask your self, but someone knocked on the door the door can't knock it self,\"  Rebuttal:   What Pro gets wrong is that a knock on the door is a good reason to suspect that someone is behind the door. To draw further on this analogy, it is \"nonsensical\" to believe someone is behind the door without any good evidence(e.g doorbell, knock). Islam so far is \"nonsensical\" as it was not supported with good evidence.   REBUTTAL  Necessary conditions for a miracle-claim:  (C1) Revealed knowledge cannot exist before Mohammad's time.  (C2) Revealed knowledge cannot be scientifically inaccurate.  (C3) Qur'anic verses cannot be subjectively and wrongly interpreted.  (C4) Interpretation cannot commit the fallacy of the excluded middle or the Texas Sharpshooter logical fallacy.  Moon has borrowed light miracle-claim  Violation of C1:   Anaxagoras(400-500BC) asserted centuries before the Qur'an was revealed that: ”The moon does not have its own light, but light from the sun.”[2] This knowledge was also known by Thales centuries before that[3].  Big Bang miracle claim  Qur'anic verse:   \"Have not those who disbelieve known that   the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them  ...\"  Violation of C4:   The Qur'an says no such thing as the Big Bang but speaks of parting the actual Earth and the heavens. The Earth didn't exist at the time of the Big Bang.  Violation of C1:    In Sumerian literature which precedes the Qur'an, we find the same claim in the   Epic of Gilgamesh  : “When the heavens had been separated from the earth, when the earth had been delimited from the heavens...”[4]  Seven-skies miracle claim  Pro claims   that the Qur'an's seven skies are the sky, solar system and the Big bang.  Violation of C4:   This is a classic example of a Texas Sharpshooter fallacy: A logical fallacy in which pieces of information that have no relationship to one another are called out for their similarities[5]. How are the Big Bang and the solar system skies?  Sun's orbit miracle-claim  Violation of C1:   Hipparchus(190–120 BC) described with precision the elliptical orbits of the sun, and Babylonian astronomy, centuries before   Hipparchus,   spoke of the sun's orbit[6,7].  ...  Pro then gives   many reasons I found irrelevant to the topic like \"Muslims cannot eat pork\" and \"Women in Islam wear Hijab\".   SUMMARY  I've argued throughout this debate that agnostic atheism makes more sense than Islam, Christianity and Judaism as it shows a better sense of judgment based on the burden proof and insufficiency of evidence in Pro's position.

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nYes. God has accepted slavery. But what kind of slavery? I have no idea how slavery is in Christianity. But I tell you about the rights of slaves in Islam. I'll post a comment for your second argument.  \\n  \\r\\n1. The sense of brotherhood  \\r\\nIslam has created a notion that both master and slave were brothers, one to the other, by inculcating an awareness that all men were created by the same God and were the children of the same parents,\"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.\" (Quran 49:13)  \\r\\nGod has cut apart the very root of all forms of narrow mindedness that arose out of the feelings of superior birth.  \\r\\nThe prophet had taught that righteousness wasn't measured on the basis of color, race or wealth, but on the basis of God-fearing alone. \"The Arab has no superiority over the non-Arab or the non-Arab over the Arab; the white over the black or the black over the white except in the matter of God-fearing.\"  \\r\\nWhere slaves are mentioned, God remarked that \"You are of one another.\" (4:25) He makes it clear that both master and slave are brothers and that it is circumstances alone which force slavery upon some people.  \\n  \\r\\n2. An awareness concerning the rights of the slave  \\r\\nThe slave was a mere commodity item in all ancient societies. His lot was confined to duties alone. His obligation was simply to strive for an increase in the comforts and luxury enjoyed by the master and in this regard, there was to be no compromise whatsoever. It was a paramount necessity that the slave was in good shape in order to be able to work for his master. The slaves were housed in yards which sufficed to accommodate not even the cattle and other livestock. As for the clothes that they were provided with, they were sufficient not even to cover their nakedness.  \\r\\nIslam brought about a transformation in the situation. It taught that slave had rights as well. The prophet said:\"They are your brothers and relatives. Let each one provide for the brother under him with the food that he himself eats and with the clothes that he himself wears. Place not upon them any task that is overbearing for them. If you do assign them a difficult task, you must help them in its execution.\"  \\r\\nThe duty of the slave, in primitive societies, was never confined to mere labour. He was also doomed to be at the receiving end of his master\"s sadistic pleasure-seekings. To be always ready to kill and to be killed for the sake of his master\"s pleasure. God ordered that such a state of affairs must change. It instructed in the humane and proper treatment of the slaves.\" Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good,\"and to relatives, orphans, the needy, ..., the companion at your side, the traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful.\" (4:36)  \\r\\nThe prophet said:\"If anyone kills a slave, we shall kill him. If anyone maims a slave, we shall maim him as well. If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him.\"  \\r\\nFrom being the choice commodity for the master\"s choicest desire, the slave was being transformed into a being with his very own personality and rights. It was in a society in which existed the heinous practice of castrating slaves that the prophet had, in the most unambiguous terms, declared that the master who castrates his slave will, in turn, \"be castrated by us.\" The slaves were castrated in order that their sexual impulses be destroyed, whereby, they could then be made to work like animals. Islam, which prohibited this practice, particularly instructs that means should be made available for the satisfaction of the sexual instincts of the slave also. \"Marry those among you who are single, and the virtuous ones among your slaves, male or female: if they are in poverty, Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah is Ample-giving, and He knows all things.\" (24:32)  \\r\\nGod also prohibited the system of forcing female slaves into prostitution. \"But let them who find not the means for marriage abstain from sexual relations until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract for eventual emancipation from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek thereby the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is to them, after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.\"(24:33)  \\r\\nThe Prophet taught against even uttering anything that might injure the self-respect of the slave. The prophet had made it clear that the slave, too, enjoyed self-respect upon which none had the right to trespass.  \\r\\nIslam teaches that the slave has the right to become even a leader and that in the event that he does get appointed as a leader, it is obligatory to obey him. \"Even if it be a negro slave, with hair like dried grapes, who is appointed as your leader, you must hear and obey him.\"  \\r\\n\"Seat him behind thee for he is thy brother and it is the same soul as yours that is within him.\"  \\n  \\r\\nIslam gave new meaning to the relation between master and slave by insisting that the master and the slave both had the same soul. It is true, nevertheless, that the slave does fall under the jurisdiction of the master. However, the master is duty-bound to fulfill the rights of the slave. It is his duty to meet the slave\"s requirements of food, clothing, sexual gratification and so on. The slave is never to be harmed. He shouldn't be put into difficulty by entrusting him with burdensome tasks as well. In such fashion did Islam create a revolution of sorts in raising the slave, for the first time in history, to the position of a free man.  \\r\\nIt was through this way that it became possible for Islam to bridge the wide gap that existed between the mental states of the master and the slave. The end result of this revolution was that the owner was emancipated from the belief that the slave was a commodity on which could be carried out his choicest desire while the slave was freed of the notion that he was doomed to a fate in which he was to bear, and to be patient and labouring always.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Declared the emancipation of slaves to be an act of righteousness.  \\r\\nBy declaring the slave\"s to be an existence which had rights of its own, Islam had made slavery non-existent. Without stopping at that point, however, it went further by turning to a course of action which would, in time, serve to eliminate the system in a very practical sense indeed. This practical step which Islam had adopted to make slavery virtually non-existent was its act of declaring the emancipation of slaves to be an act of righteousness.  \\r\\nGod said:\"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered\" prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them. So they who have believed in him,honored him supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful.\" (7:157)  \\r\\nThis verse which makes it clear that the emancipation of slaves is an act of the highest virtue goes as follows:\" What can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass? It is the freeing of a slave or feeding on a day of severe hunger. An orphan of near relationship or a needy person in misery.\" (90:12-16)  \\r\\nAs far as the emancipation of slaves was concerned, the prophet had exhorted his companions towards it by making an example himself. He set free the slaves who were in his possession.  \\r\\nThere are numerous sayings of the prophet which encourage the freeing of slaves. \"If anyone sets free a believing slave, each of his body parts will be set free from Hell so much so that it will be the hand for a hand, the leg for a right up to the sexual organ for the sexual organ.\"  \\r\\nOnce, the Prophet was asked:\"Which is the highest act in the emancipation of slaves?\" he replied, \"To set free the most valuable slave of the master.\"  \\r\\nHe, while talking about those who become deserving of God\"s reward twice, said, \"He who confers a proper behavior upon the female slave under him, then gives her the best education, sets her free and then marries her will become entitled to a double reward.\"  \\n  \\r\\n4. Emancipation of slaves was made the act of expiation for many types of sin  \\r\\nIn addition to encouraging the believers towards its commission by declaring the emancipation of slaves to be a virtuous deed, Islam recommended it as an act of expiation for many types of sin. The atonement for sins like unintentional murder and breaking one\"s vow of not approaching his wife was the freeing of one slave. As for those who were not ready to free slaves in expectation of God's reward alone, the command which made the emancipation of slaves an atoning act for sins committed, nevertheless, made it necessary for them to do so.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nYou arrogant Xtians know nothing. YOUR see here, I can quote what's written, Therefore the text means as I believe it to intend - haughty none sense. Dude the Middle Ages have long sensed past into oblivion. You arrogant xtian fools no longer have a sword at the throat of the Jewish people!  \\n  \\r\\nYour vile translations of the Hebrew T'NaCH merit total and utter contempt. Ignorant bore, The Books of the Prophets never had chapters and verses - that's an Xtian addition. All logic stands upon the foundation of Order. The \"organization\" of the Books of the Prophets N E V E R spun around the artificially imposed Xtian none sense religion. The Books of the NaCH/Prophets and Holy Writings/ operates around a completely different Order arrangement - known as sugiot.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Talmud, Codified in about 450CE also follows the tradition of sugiot Order. Your horrid and despicable dead religion A) totally ignored the arranged Order of the NaCH literature and B) therefore remains totally oblivious to the Oral Torah logic system revealed at Sinai 40 days after the sin of the Golden Calf wherein Israel thinking that Moshe the prophet had died demanded from Aaron a Way for post Moshe Israel to systematically and logically interpret the Written Torah - the Constitution of the Republic.  \\n  \\r\\nBy contrast, Your dead despicable religion perverted the T'NaCH literature to fit as their Old Testament in this horrid new religion which worships the imaginary myth Jesus son of Zeus as God. Isaiah as a prophet has no power to over rule or contradict the Torah Constitution. Like duh!  \\n  \\r\\nHillel HaGadol, Or Hillel HaZaken, Also known as Hillel HaBavli: born, According to tradition, In Babylon c. 110 BCE, Died 10 CE in Jerusalem) a Jewish Torah scholar and leader; his instruction on how to interpret the Torah stands to this day as once of the most influential figures in all of Jewish history. Hillel taught Jewish logic. The Oral Torah which the Xtian idiot church denies, Logic. Both the NaCH and the Talmud codifications exist based upon this unique logic system which the evil morons of Xtianity deny.  \\n  \\r\\nHillel stream lined his rules of logic by which to interpret the Masoret/Traditions sealed by the fore fathers of Israel - Torah Prophets Writings Talmud Midrash Siddur - the Sages of Israel sealed these texts, Therein giving all generations of the Jewish people an identical Masoret/Tradition, By which to build faith.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Xtian fool translators, In their zeal to translate the rejected T'NaCH of the Jews - they call it to this day \"old testament' - these babbling idiots organized the Books of the T'NaCH literature in a way that suited their tastes and interests. Order changes how a person thinks and perceives reality. For example the letters which make the word God, If re arranged make also make the word Dog! Such subtleties the Xtian brain dead translators totally ignored.  \\n  \\r\\nHillel the Elder based his 7 rules of logical interpretation on the assumption that Jews - forget the Goyim, Torah instruction does not apply to these foreign aliens b/c Goyim to this very day never accepted the Torah revelation at Sinai. You outsiders looking in only know how to jabber \"about\" a topic; fools of your kind never attempt to learn \"through\" a subject.  \\n  \\r\\nDeductive and Inductive logic requires the skill to make comparisons and contrasts. The formal study of any literature operates by making \"measured\" comparisons and contrasts. Brain dead Goyim love to read their bibles, But virtually never attempt to learn that literature as a formal discipline. The inflated egotism of Goyim, Perhaps best summed up as: \"DO NOT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS. . . I HAVE MY PERSONAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS! \" Religion for Xtians, \"do you personally believe brother! \" Faith of fools revolves around the ego of I. The first word of Xtian belief systems - irregardless of the creed Catholic or Protestant- the word I. I -- has nothing to do with objective logic. In fact I -- perverts all logic by skewing its results in favor of I.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Talmud stands upon the foundations of T'NaCH. Duh. The Talmud exists as a Common Law codification of Jewish law. Therefore the T'NaCH functions upon the exact same principle upon which stands all Common Law legal systems - precedents! This means, That for a person to learn a \"sugia\" of NaCH, Formal learning - based upon Jewish logic - absolutely requires a measured comparison of a sugia of NaCH to similar sugiot of NaCH.  \\n  \\r\\nHillel's hermeneutics stand upon 7 basic rules. Its called the fundamentals, Of learning how to learn.  \\r\\n1. M30;al (M31;ol) wa-M17;omer: \"Argumentum a minori ad majus\" or \"a majori ad minus\"; corresponding to the scholastic proof a fortiori.  \\r\\n2. Gezerah shawah: Argument from analogy. Biblical passages containing synonyms or homonyms are subject, However much they differ in other respects, To identical definitions and applications.  \\r\\n3. Binyan ab mi-katub eM17;ad: Application of a provision found in one passage only to passages which are related to the first in content but do not contain the provision in question.  \\r\\n4. Binyan ab mi-shene ketubim: The same as the preceding, Except that the provision is generalized from two Biblical passages.  \\r\\n5. Kelal u-PeraM89; and PeraM89; u-kelal: Definition of the general by the particular, And of the particular by the general.  \\r\\n6. Ka-yoN27;e bo mi-maM31;om aM17;er: Similarity in content to another Scriptural passage.  \\r\\n7. Dabar ha-lamed me-'inyano: Interpretation deduced from the context.  \\n  \\r\\nThese basic Amendments to the 13 middot of Oral Torah logic which Moshe the Prophet orally heard at Horev 40 on the Day of Atonement, According to Hillel interpreting the Written Torah requires total reliance upon Jewish schools of logic and totally excludes the classic ancient Greek philosophy of logic taught by Plato and Aristotle.  \\n  \\r\\nYou puff up your vain ego by quoting from Isaiah 53, As if Jews never before read those p'sukim/verses. Idiot. Based upon the logic of #6. &amp; #7. , I introduce the following Amendment to these logical rules. (1) Oral Torah middot which Moshe the prophet originally heard on Mr. Horev (2) by making a comparison of one sugia of NaCH, Specifically in this case Isaiah to other sugiot of Isaiah containing the identical Oral Torah middot. Based upon the rule: learn the Torah by means of bringing close precedents.  \\n  \\r\\nThe sugia of Isaiah which contains the specific verses which you quoted starts [employing your chapter/verse system] 52:12 to 53:12. This Order of sugiot patterns the Written Torah which has an organization around sugiot. The Written Torah serves as a precedent for how the Books of the Prophets organized their Order. The sugia which you quote specific verses therefrom contains 4 Oral Torah middot. [Its not my purpose to teach Oral Torah to a foreign alien outsider like yourself. Therefore the specific names of these 4 middot shall I shall not list].  \\n  \\r\\nNow employing the search for a valid precedent [T'NaCH stands upon the principle of Common Law. Common Law stands upon precedents], I must locate other sugiot which contain these identical 4 middot. The premise works like this: if i throw a 2lb rock into a still body of water, The ripple effect produced by the impact of the stone upon the tranquil waters. . . That if i take this identical stone and throw it upon a separate tranquil body of water, That this stone shall produce as similar ripple effect. Therefore, By this premise, If i find other sugiot of Isaiah which contain these exact same middot as found in the sugia from which you quoted, Then the 2nd \"witness\" from Isaiah give me the depth by which i can comprehend the intent of the sugia from which you quoted. Meaning I have found a valid close precedent permitting me to interpret the intent of the Framer of our sugia in question.  \\n  \\r\\nIt took about 2 minutes to locate another sugia in the Book of Isaiah which contains these exact 4 Oral Torah middot which the God of Israel orally communicated to the prophet Moshe on Yom Kippor/the day of Atonement/ 40 days following the sin of the Golden Calf. The sugia: 26:1 to 26:10.  \\n  \\r\\nEarlier when asked by you about the meaning of Isaiah 53, My response: that it referred to Israel in exile. I shall now amend that explanation by adding the comparison to the Jews of Germany and Europe during the horror years of the Nazi 3rd Reich. Three years after the 1000 year Reich stood in total ruins and destruction, The inferior race slaughtered by the European sub human barbarians stood nose to nose with 5 Arab armies aided by Britain and defeated them in war. The Europeans experienced total shock! How could a people whom these same European monsters murdered 75% of European Jewry, 3 years later totally crush 5 Arab armies aided with the military assistance of Britain? !  \\n  \\r\\nFor over 2000 years Jews endured the taunts of Xtians, Prayers made every Easter, Followed by a pogrom, For the \"perfidious\" or \"treacherous\" Jews! The wicked vile scum church declared that the cursed Jews must forever wander the earth as despised and abhorred exiles for the sin of killing God.  \\n  \\r\\nJustice! Now Jews rule our own country and the evil wicked church stands in total exile - waiting for the 2nd coming of jesus son of Zeus! Goyim Xtians have to portion in the Torah/T'NaCH faith. When they die, Their bodies feed the worms, Because they have not now or ever any portion into the world to come. They pray to a mythical imaginary man/god and we Jews have mocked these ignorant arrogant stupid scum bag fools for over 2000 years!</td>\n",

Ste93 provided an alternative definition... to which there was absolutely no outcome. But that is besides the point.  \\n  \\r\\nThe reason I have an \"observation\" section is to point out how quickly abusive this debate has become. What started as the claim \"It was celebrated by many Muslims as a great victory because they believe that the terrorists are going to paradise and they will be joining them too.\" [1] (currently page 3 of the comments) When asked to defend this claim, he threw random verses of the Qura'an out in the comments section without having a clue as to their context, but then accepted the debate. I was reluctant to challenge him expecting to have to respond to 8000 characters' worth of mistranslated and contextually-skewed verses. Instead, I got something worse. Ste93 has chosen to limit the scope of the debate ONLY to the extremist interpretations of the Qura'an that are condemned by every Muslim scholar on the planet. To quote Ste93 from this debate in particular:  \\n  \\r\\n\"Firstly, I do not claim that all Muslims celebrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but some undoubtedly did.\"  \\n  \\r\\n\"Now, of course not all Muslims take a literal interpretation of the Koran (for which we should be grateful), but you can't deny that some people do. Even if it is a minority, some people read passages like these and can then justify terrorism.\"  \\n  \\r\\n\"I do not think the 9/11 terrorists were inherently evil people (like Hitler and Stalin were); they genuinely believed that they were doing good in the name of Allah.\"  \\n  \\r\\nWhat I now have to defend is the terrorist ideology as a result of my opponent, which I refuse to do. Instead, we will respond to the claims made to prove that the verses demonstrated are NOT violent, and that all terrorist interpretations are simply misunderstandings of an otherwise perfect revelation.  \\n  \\r\\no Arguments  \\n  \\r\\nFaith is supposedly the inspiration for Muslim terrorism. When we look to the quotes my opponent has brought, we can analyze them one at a time and see how fallacious it is to simply quote the most complex book in the world.  \\n  \\r\\n\"And what is wrong with you that you fight not in the Cause of Allah, and for those weak, illtreated and oppressed among men, women, and children, whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from You one who will protect, and raise for us from You one who will help.\"\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'm guessing my opponent didn't even read this verse? It says, in other words, \"You all must defend the oppressed people who ask for God's mercy.\" Literally; look at the verse. \"...what is WRONG with you that you FIGHT NOT... FOR THOSE WEAK, ILLTREATED AND OPPRESSED... whose cry is: \"Our Lord! Rescue us from... OPPRESSORS\" (capitalization for emphasis, as I cannot bold).  \\n  \\r\\nNext, my opponent cites hadith. \"I have been ordered to fight with the people till they say, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah.\" I have now learned that even Hadith is taken out of context; I thought it was just the Qura'an people defame in contextually skewed grounds. Here is the whole Hadith my opponent cited.  \\n  \\r\\n\"Narrated Abu Huraira: When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, 'Umar said, \"O Abu Bakr! How can you fight these people although Allah's Apostle said, 'I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, 'and whoever said, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', Allah will save his property and his life from me, unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account will be with Allah?' \"Abu Bakr said, \"By Allah! I will fight whoever differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property (according to Allah's Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to pay to Allah's Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it.\" 'Umar said, \"By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr's chest towards the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.\"\" [2]  \\n  \\r\\nThis situation is referring to (as stated in the first line) after the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) died, a number of people became apostates and left Islam. The conversation between Abu Bakr and Umar, both Caliphs, referred to how they should be dealt with. To those who do not know, back in the day the government was not separate from religion. So, leaving the religion is equivalent to leaving the government; in other words, treason. Treason, I hope my opponent would agree, is punishable. The problem is that this Hadith is not longer temporally relevant because we don't have a government that is connected with the religion.  \\n  \\r\\nThe final quote my opponent provides is \"Lo! Allah loveth them who battle for His cause in ranks, as if they were a solid structure.\" It is well explained here [3] Basically, it is one of the many ways in which we can fight for Allah's cause through \"jihad\". I'm reluctant to use this term, but I will explain it. Jihad means struggle, if I say (in Arabic) \"ana am ijtahid\" it means \"I am struggling\". There are several types of jihad, which are sometimes used in English literature to describe the plot type. Man vs. himself, Man vs. Man, etc. In this case, what we see Allah asking us to do is to unite as one in our jihad; to struggle for him, and to defend Islam as the \"umma\" we are all united under. I hope I have explained this well enough; if not, I will try to do so more extensively in the next round.  \\n  \\r\\nAs regarding everything else my opponent refers to; let me define martyrdom. It is \"death that is imposed because of the person's adherence of a religious faith or cause\". [4] Let us not confuse this; in Islam, those who are \"sha'hed\" are martyrs, and they are people who died in DEFENSE of Islam or their nation. Succinctly, to be a praised martyr in Islam is to die in defense of your nation, not in an offensive terrorist plot.  \\n  \\r\\no Conclusion  \\n  \\r\\nWhat we are left with is really little hope at a con ballot, pro being the only way to go for the following reasons.  \\n  \\r\\n1) The terrorist ideology is a false interpretation.  \\r\\n2) Martyrdom is not equivalent to terrorism.  \\r\\n3) Contextual skew and misinterpretation does not justify extremism.  \\n  \\r\\nMy opponent has failed to uphold the burden of proof initially placed upon him, so we're left with one more round in which we can hope that this is done. With that, I'll hand the debate over to con and remind him that, as many verses as he cites, I can justify. Quoting the Qura'an hundreds of times fallaciously does not amount to an argument.  \\n  \\r\\nAlso, I thank the readers for their time.  \\n  \\r\\no Sources  \\n  \\r\\n[1]   http://www.debate.org...  \\n  \\r\\n[2]   http://www.muslimway.org...  \\n  \\r\\n[3]   http://www.islamonline.net...  \\n  \\r\\n[4]   http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu...   \n",

But what does it matter? You personally may interpret things this way, but that doesn't mean every Muslim should or indeed every non-Muslim. ***These passages could be taken as meaning kill people.*** If Allah condemned this type of behaviour so much, he would not have made his book so ambiguous and subject to pretty much any interpretation.\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'd like to focus our attention on the sentence between stars. My opponent is absolutely wrong; no where does the Qura'an mean to kill people at any one point. To have such a ridiculous interpretation, one must deliberately abuse the teachings of the Qura'an by taking verses out of context or mistranslating them to come up with what is modern-day terrorism. As an example, there is a verse that is commonly cited that says \"slay the non-believers wherever you find them,\" or something along those lines. The problem is, this verse comes from a historical event- the \"non-believers\" in that passage is very specifically referring to the hostile family of pagan Mecca, the time period during which Muhammad was receiving revelation. Is a nation supposed to recite verses to a violent and armed Godless people like the Meccans were, who literally had a price on Muhammad's head? No, they would fight back, and I hope my opponent would agree.  \\n  \\r\\n\"It is a fact that 19 Muslims committed the 9/11 attrocity. I ask my opponent then to offer  \\r\\nan explanation as to why they would do this. Also, if Islam did not exist, do you think the twin towers would still be standing.\"  \\n  \\r\\nFirst, the 9-11 conspiracy theory leaves us all dubious as to whether or not the above is a fact [1]. I hope my opponent has heard of it. Even if it was the 19 \"Muslims\" my opponent claims it was, like I said, they aren't Muslims, and they don't follow Islamic doctrine or the teachings of the Qura'an. They are violence loving extremists who are militantly mobilized; they kill other Muslims, how does that make ANY sense? Because they're NOT Muslims.  \\n  \\r\\n\"It is also a fact that many Muslims reacted violently when a cartoon depicting Muhammad was published in a Danish newspaper. Is this not a sign of intolerance?\"  \\n  \\r\\nThis is false. It seems my opponent didn't read enough about the event, but here is the truth behind it [2]. As a tl;dr: there is a group known as 'RevolutionMuslim' who claimed to be the violent outcry of Muslims when, in fact, not one Muslim really even cared about SouthPark's cartoon or the Danish newspaper. Meanwhile, this group was run by 2 'Muslims'; in fact, they were 2 zionist Jews pretending to be Muslim who smeared the name of Islam in America, and quite successfully if I may say so myself. At the end of the day, though, my opponent's claims are false. Islam is actually the most tolerant religion in the world that claims \"Let there be no compulsion in religion.\" (Qur'an 2:256), read more about it here [3].  \\n  \\r\\n\"Also, are Al Quaeda muslims or not?\"  \\n  \\r\\nNo.  \\n  \\r\\n\"In Christianity, there are people even U.S. congressmen) who would consider a major terrorist attack, or perhaps a major natural disaster, as a god thing, as it suggests the second coming of Christ (it does not take much thought to realise how conter-productive and dangerous such an attitude can be). Similarly there were Muslims that celebrated the 9/11 attacks. Al Quaeda for a start.\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'm not sure anything mattered up until the last two sentences. My opponent claims Muslims celebrated 9-11, but has provided no evidence. Anyways, for the celebrations I found these articles to more accurately depict the situation [4] [5]. To summarize what's in the articles, \"Muslims\" who celebrated were the more extreme, but the large majority of the Islamic world was very sympathetic and condemned the attack.  \\n  \\r\\n\"My opponent (rather defensively) seems to be suggesting that Islam could never be a cause for evil in the world. I'm afraid history would disagree. Would the world be a better place if people weren't tied to ancient scriptures and dogma? I think so, it'll be interesting t see how my opponent may argue against this.\"  \\n  \\r\\nI'm afraid history would disagree with my opponent. The crusades, initiated by the crumbling Byzantines, brought Western Europe over to Jerusalem to reconquer it violently from the Muslims. The tale tells that the city was knee-high in blood; the women were raped, then killed along with the children and elderly. Meanwhile, when the Muslim tactician and skilled army general known as Saladin took his position at the age of 20, he reconquered Jerusalem. He is renowned for his benevolence and tolerance [6]. Here is an important passage from the article.  \\n  \\r\\n//In return for an attack made by the Crusaders of the Kerak on Muslim pilgrims in 1187, Saladin moved his army to northern Palestine and defeated the much larger Crusader army in the decisive battle of Hettin (July 4, 1187). Three months after this battle, Saladin captured Jerusalem. Unlike the Christians 88 years earlier, who made Jerusalem a bloodbath, Saladin did not loot, murder or seek revenge for the Muslims. He spared the lives of 100,000 Christians and allowed Christian pilgrims in Jerusalem after its fall. In this benevolent act, Saladin was simply emulating Prophet Muhammad as the Prophet reentered his birth-city of Mecca. When Muhammad returned to Mecca with ten thousand people, he entered it without any bloodshed. He told its people with his famous words: \"Go about (wherever you please), for you are set free.\"//  \\n  \\r\\nMy opponent has insufficiently upheld his burden. I urge a pro ballot, and thank everyone for their time.  \\n  \\r\\n---Sources---  \\n  \\r\\n[1]   http://www.911truth.org...  \\n  \\r\\n[2]   http://www.loonwatch.com...  \\n  \\r\\n[3]   http://www.missionislam.com...  \\n  \\r\\n[4]   http://politics.usnews.com...  \\n  \\r\\n[5]   http://en.wikipedia.org...  \\n  \\r\\n[6]   http://www.islamic-study.org...

He has not done this so far.  What he offered was an unsupported (possibly fabricated) survey stating that Bashar has more support than the FSA. After I traced Pro's source and its sources, I was astonished by the details which lead me to the conclusion that this all was highly likely to be a fabrication,  1- Pro contradicts his own sources when he says the survey was \"done by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (commonly known as NATO).\" According to his source, the survery data   was only relayed   to the NATO.  2- [From the original source of the survery, World Tribune]  \"The sources said   no formal polling was taken in Syria  ...   They said   the   data came from a range of activists and independent organizations   that   were working in Syria, particularly in relief efforts.\"  So basically, the original source of the survery claims that \"the sources\" say that the polling was not formal, and that the data came from a range of unidentified activists and organizations, not a survey group. No numbers, no names, no citations, no details about the survey—nothing. Just a blog referring to another without any actual tenable data.  3- Not reported by mainstream media, n  o mention of this report by NATO (I even tried searching library databases)  , actual NATO Data(if any exists) absent from the sources of the articles that mention it.   I can conclude that this is just a fabrication that is not supported by any tenable evidence  My Argument  :  A- Disadvantages of Bashar Al-Assad continuing his presidency  1- Loss of economic and diplomatic ties between Syria and most of the countries in the world. This is namely because of the Syrian regime's human-rights abuses and the boycott of Bashar Al-Assad around the world.  2- The continuation of the economic sanctions on Syria on the basis that it is an inhumane dictatorship.  3- Many Syrian refugees would live under wretched conditions in Lebanon and other countries, given that they are mostly Sunnah who avoided the genocides in Syria(some of them are even wives and children of FSA members).  4- The conflict between Syria's neighbour Turkey and Bashar Al-Assad, which puts Syria in another peril, given that Turkey supports the FSA and is against Assad's human-rights abuses. This means that if Bashar stayed in power, we might witness a war that would have harsh consequences on Syria.  A1- Loss of economic and diplomatic ties between Syria and most of the countries in the world.  Because of the inhumane practices of the Syrian government, it has lost many of its diplomatic relations with previous allies such as: Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, United States, Belgium, Spain, and the Gulf States[1]. It even has been excommunicated from the Arab League in 2011 and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation in 2012. This, of course, has negative effects on Syria's economy, because many of those states refuse to engage in any economic relations until Assad is overthrown. That clarified, Syria's economy is in a deplorable state and it needs all the help it can get from the rest of the world, provided that the Iranian support is not enough to keep the economy standing on its two feet. For instance, the Syrian government’s reserves decreased from $18 billion to $2 billion because of the conflict, according to a report released by the Syrian Centre for Policy Research in January 2013. According to that same report, $48 billion is currently required for the reconstruction of Syria with a predicted amount at $60-200 billion if the conflict continued. This all occurred even with a financial support from Iran, which means that Syria needs the support of Eastern and Western states which have boycotted the government because of Assad.  [1]   http://www.haaretz.com...  ...  A2- The continuation of economic sanctions on Syria.  The economic sanctions had dreadful consequences on the Syrian Oil Production. For instance, the Syrian regime is unable to find buyers for around 140,000 barrels of crude oil per day, which forces the Syrian state treasury to loose about $5 billion dollars a year[2]. Moreover, the Arab League Economic Committee opposed Bashar Al-Assad by suspending flights from member states to Syria, ending transactions with the Syrian central bank and freezing all Syrian assets in Arab countries[3]. Syria is already in a deplorable state due to the accumulated effects of the civil war, so the removal of Bashar Al-Assad would remove those sanctions and help in enhancing the economic state.  [2]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  ...  [3]   http://www.aljazeera.com...  ...  A3- Many Syrian immigrants would remain to live as refugees under wretched conditions.  The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon alone is approximated to be 1.2 million[4]. This great influx of refugees is namely because of Sunnah escaping violence and oppression from the Alawite minority, and as the Syrian National TV and Pro-Assad media stated, the fact that the FSA members are sending their families to Lebanon to protect them from the Syrian regime[5]. If Assad continued to rule, there is no guarantee that those refugees would be allowed to return to their lands, which are mostly lands that have been destroyed and could be easily conquered by Alawite residents, who are already against the wide expansion of the Sunnah in Syria. Assad, in my opinion, would prefer them not to come back because of their infamous support of the FSA and the fact that they are mostly Sunnah; thus, a source of opposition to his regime.   [4]   http://www.yalibnan.com...  ...  [5]   http://english.al-akhbar.com...  ...  A4- The conflict between Syria's neighbour Turkey and Bashar Al-Assad.  The Syrian national army is not in a position to fight against a nation like Turkey, and Syria had enough bombings and battles. Provided that Bashar is despised by Turkey, it is advisable to remove him to restore diplomatic and economic ties between those two countries, at least to ensure that a conflict is not even possible. There many reasons to believe that such a war is possible. For example, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan announced in October 5 2012 \"We are not interested in war, but we're not far from it either,\" after the incident in October 3 when Turkish troops attacked Syria[6].   [6]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  ...  B- Advantages of having the FSA  B1- Financial support from many rich countries  Qatar and KSA have supported many Arab nations in critical situations such as Lebanon, and they are accused of financially supporting the FSA[7]. Hence, it is guaranteed that they would donate billions of dollars to help reconstruct Syria and support the FSA's leadership. Moreover, the majority of countries who opposed Assad are also expected to give out money for humanitarian purposes, which means that Syria's economy is better off with that financial support.  [7] rt.com/news/arming-syria-rebels-saudi-913/  B2- Democracy and political life in Syria  Assad wants to re-establish a dictatorship, while the rebels are seeking a democracy. Some of them want it based on Islamic principles and others on secular ones, but that at least creates a diversity and many political parties, instead of the traditional solo party that governs Syria.  B3- Return of thinkers and activists who were shunned by the Syrian government  There are many thinkers who were shunned from Syria after years of persecution and censorship, and have been working with the rebels from abroad even with some objections to some of their violent acts. I'm going to list a few. Syrian lawyer and human rights activist Razan Zaitouneh(2012 Ibn Rushd Award winner), and Syrian author Samar Yazbek(Pen Pinter literary prize winner)[8]. They are expected to return and help reform the rebels if Assad is overthrown, given that his regime is the reason for their exile.

Anyhow, I'm going to provide my rebuttal as I promised in the earlier round.  A- Can Bashar Al-Assad really stop the armed clashes and the civil disorders?  This seems to be a main assumption in my opponent's argument, even though it is unrealistic due to many reasons:  1- The frail state of the Syrian national army which is now relying on Hezbollah to fight its battles[1].   2- The nature of the FSA's resistance, which is basically coming from \"beehive\" military factions of a persecuted majority in Syria[2].   3- The presence of foreign soldiers in the FSA that pass the wide Syrian borders, and who are backed by many rich nations in the Arab world. This point was also listed by my opponent, and it ensures the presence of a continuous and well-funded resistance against the Syrian regime[3].  [1]   http://www.reuters.com...  [2]   http://www.mcclatchydc.com...  [3]   http://online.wsj.com...  B- Brief critique of my opponent's main points.  B1- \"The FSA is not well-defined nor do they have control or any responsibility over their actions.\"   Even if the FSA were as disorganized, chaotic and dispersed as my opponent claims, this does not necessarily mean that they would always stay like that. Take as an example Hezbollah which started as a set of disorganized and \"not well-defined\" factions in south Lebanon, and after the retreat of Israel, changed into one of the most organized and powerful militias in the world[4].  [4]   http://www.worldsecuritynetwork.com...  B2- \"The various factions will not be able to unify. As said before, these factions are already claiming territory and not allowing certain factions to pass.\"   According to their own definition, they are not a military that holds territory but one that seeks to spread the Syrian army in all Syria so that it weakens its defences[5]. Even though they are dispersed because of this strategy, they fight for the same goal and help each other with weapons, artillery, shelter, food and military operations[6]. The talk about their dispersion is exaggerated and inaccurate.   [5]   http://www.mcclatchydc.com...  [6]   http://www.thenational.ae...  B3- \"The only reason the U.S. wishes to aid the rebels in an attempt to destabilize the Middle-east.\"   This is a non-sequitur. Even if it was true, it doesn't work as a reason for why the FSA cannot rule. The US, and if truly wanted destabilization, would ensure that Assad stays ruling while the FSA continues fighting him, which contradicts putting the FSA in power.  B4- \"Many, at least a large minority, of the rebels are mercenaries, some foreign backed. And many more of them are Islamist fundamentalist Jihadist.\"   My opponent has to explain why a majority of \"Islamist fundamentalist Jihadist\" would oppose a Jihad call from Lebanese Salafees[7]. It is clear that the majority of the FSA are moderate Muslims, who identify themselves separately from Jabhat Al-Nusrah because of their dismissal of radical Islam. As an FSA spokesman in Aleppo said, the FSA doesn't share the beliefs of Jabhat Al-Nusrah, but they are fighting the same enemy together[8]. Needless to say, the Pro-Syrian forces are using Hezbollah, a mercenary of Jihadists, and newly-trained Shite jihadists on their side. Hence, a mirrored situation exists even if my opponent's accusation was true.  [7]   http://www.naharnet.com...  [8]   http://www.usatoday.com...  B5- \"The FSA and the various rebel-factions will not be able to form a coercive government.\"  It would be effective to state this reason, if Bashar could actually control Syria as he did before. But this is clearly not the case, given the Syrian government lost its power in many parts of Syria. Therefore, it is pointless to use this as a reason for why the FSA should not rule, when Bashar Al-Assad has lost his tight grip on the Syrian nation, and cannot form a coercive government due to all the changes.  B6- \"If Assad is knocked out of power or if the rebels are not exterminated then the country will be thrown into eternal conflict and, eventually, forgotten by the media and the public, as always.\"  I wouldn't say \"eternal,\" but definitely long-lasting, and this is currently the situation in Syria even with Assad present. The proxy war is continuing in both scenarios, which means that this claim is ignoring the mirrored situation which won't be that different in this regard.  C- Rebuttal of specific claims in my opponent's argument  Contention 1: \"But the rebels have indeed seized a Saudi-owned chemical plant and has obviously used it against innocent civilians in an attempt to pin the blame on the government.\"  According to my opponent's citation, this was done by Jabhat al-Nusra, not the FSA. And I agreed to debate based on the condition that those should be treated as two different groups. Here is the citation: \"On 8 December, it was reported that members of the jihadist Al-Nusra Front had recently captured a Saudi-owned toxic chemicals plant outside of Aleppo.\" In addition to that, the citation does not say that chemical bombs from this plant were used against innocent civilians. This is a baseless claim.  It is true that there is no proof yet on who is behind the chemical bombings, but there is good evidence that the Syrian government is behind it:  1- \"Zahir al-Sakit, a former Syrian army general from the chemical weapons branch, said he was instructed to use chemical weapons during a battle with the FSA in the southwestern area of Hauran. But instead, Sakit disobeyed the orders and swapped the chemicals with disinfectant water he called \"Javel water.\"[9]  2- \"An 23 April 2013 the New York Times reported that the British and French governments had sent a confidential letter to the United Nations Secretary General, claiming that there was evidence that the Syrian government had used chemical weapons in Aleppo, Homs, and perhaps Damascus.\"[10]  3- \"By 25 April the U.S intelligence assessment was that the Assad regime had likely used chemical weapons – specifically sarin gas.\"[11]  4- \"After clandestinely spending two months in Jobar, Damascus, several reporters for the French news media Le Monde personally witnessed the Syrian army's use of chemical weapons on civilians.\" [12,13]  [9]   http://english.alarabiya.net...  [10]   http://www.nytimes.com...  [11]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  [12]   http://www.lemonde.fr...  [13]   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  Contention 2: \"FSA is quite ruthless, as are other rebel factions. If they approach a male civilian who is fit for or not aiding their general cause, due to black and white thinking, in their eyes if you aren't for them then you're against them.\"  This is an outrageous generalization stated without any evidence, although it claims that it describes a dominant behaviour among the FSA members. BoP on my opponent.  Contention 3: \"I have seen dozens of videos of innocent men who have been accused of working for Assad by the FSA and executed, all the while the innocent men pleaded...\"  This won't pass here that easily. We need proof that those men were actually innocent.   \n",

In order to assume this, he must overlook the countless violent verses in the koran, beheadings, honor killings, wife beating, and the affects of the religion. First and foremost, The major difference between Christianity and Islam is its real world implications. Islam repeatedly claims to be a \"religion of peace\" this claim however, is easily refuted by a quick glance into the advent of Islam and its modern state all the way back to the caliphate.  \\n  \\r\\n1. Most Muslim countries are failed states while primarily Christian nations are wealthy and prosperous  \\n  \\r\\n2. Islam currently has the most extremists of any religion with hundreds of Islamic terrorist groups killing innocent civilians every day in the name of Allah. While it is true that Christian terrorist groups exist, they are very small compared to their muslim counterparts and their acts of terror are much less severe and find little to no backing from the Bible.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Several hundred Christian charities exist for non Christians and they provide aid and relief for displaced muslims while Islam does not operate nearly any charities for international aid. Christian Aid workers are also often at risk for kidnapping from islamic terrorists for helping in those countries  \\n  \\r\\n4. When Christians live in Muslim countries, they are constantly persecuted and are denied churches and houses of worship. When Muslims come to Christian countries, they are accepted as useful members of society and are allowed to gather and build mosques freely.  \\n  \\r\\n5. Christians in Muslim countries are killed for peacefully expressing their desire for equality. Muslims in Christian countries violently protest and demand that the government and schools change to fit their needs, claiming racism whenever they are criticized for their behavior.  \\n  \\r\\n6. Sharia law is considered higher than constitutional law in almost all Muslim countries. Sharia law promotes oppression, veiling of women, mandatory beards, religious police and a tax for non muslims. Christianity has no concept of religious law and separates church and state. with the exception of canon law, which only applies to clergy and is much less restricting than sharia.  \\n  \\r\\nthere are also several differences between the patrons of Islam (Muhammed) and Christianity (Jesus Christ).  \\n  \\r\\n1. Muhammed was a bandit and a warrior while Jesus was a preacher and a carpenter  \\n  \\r\\n2. Muhammed preached violence and demanded bodyguards while Jesus preached peace and chastised anyone who attempted to defend him with force  \\n  \\r\\n3. Muhammed took 12 wives and claimed revelations from god to justify his sex harems and polygamy. Jesus was celibate and never looked upon a woman in a lustful way  \\n  \\r\\n4. Muhammed married a 9 year old girl, fondled her and BATHED with her. Jesus ... well... didn't do that.  \\n  \\r\\n5. Muhammed spread his message through hate and war, killing anyone who wouldn't convert and taxing non muslims. Jesus spread his message through peace and baptism, using the gospel to bring people to god.  \\n  \\r\\n6. Early Muslims persecuted and killed non Muslims. Early Christians lived in constant persecution from non christians  \\n  \\r\\n7. Jesus was said to do many miracles, with several eye witnesses bearing testament to his divinity while Muhammed was never able to do one miraculous thing in his life.  \\n  \\r\\n8. Muhammed: Demanded others die for him  \\r\\nJesus: Suffered one of the most agonizing deaths for the sake of Humanity.  \\n  \\r\\n9. Jesus = most praised spiritual leader. Muhammed = most criticized spiritual leader.  \\n  \\r\\nViolent Verses in the Koran  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (2:191-193) - \"And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing...  \\r\\nbut if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)\"  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (3:151) \"Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority\". (This verse speaks directly of trinitarian christians, who Muhammad wrongfully believed to be polytheists)  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (8:12) - \"I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them\" (no reasonable person can interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle)  \\n  \\r\\nQuran (17:16) - \"And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.\"  \\n  \\r\\nIf I included all violent passages of the Koran in this argument, I would not have enough space. Now with all this in mind, We can see how Islamic terrorists can find justification for such terrible acts. The simple truth is that the Koran not only condones violence, but encourages it and claims that jihadis will have twice the reward in heaven as the peaceful muslims.  \\n  \\r\\nAnother point to consider is the advent of Islam vs the advent of Christianity. Christianity began in 33 AD after Jesus of Nazerath (or Isa Ibn Maryam) was crucified in Jerusalem. After the 12 apostles of Jesus started the religion in the upper room of Mark's house, the Roman Government didn't skip a beat in banning it and killing any christians they found. The christians, instead of taking up arms to defend themselves (which would have been justifiable) chose to follow the teachings of Jesus and turn the other cheek. Christians lived in constant fear of death until Emperor Constantine legalized Christianty in the 3rd century. At this point, Christianity had spread to all corners of the world through peaceful preaching and missionary work.  \\n  \\r\\nThe beginnings of Islam, however were extremely different and much more bloody than Christianity. Muhammed was born in Mecca to a pagan family in 570 C.E. There are debates as to whether he was a Merchant or a bandit but historical sources point to merchant as his likely occupation. In his mid 20s he married a wealthy widow named Khadija. Soon after this, he began to see visions in a cave which he believed to be \"from God\" but in reality, were likely hallucinations caused by dehydration and heat stroke. After his \"revalation\" of Islam, Muhammed began to preach in the Kabba, a pagan worship center with the arabian gods encircling it. After city authorities realized this, Muhammed was forced to emigrate to Medina where he received a much warmer welcome. In Medina, he gathered an army and told his followers that it was their sacred duty to spread Islam, starting with Mecca. Only a few years after the advent of the Religion, Islam began to spread by force, capturing Medina and executing 800 jews in a single day. After the land of Arabia was conquered and forcefully converted by muslim armies. The religion of peace exploded across the borders into Egypt, Turkey, Asia and parts of Europe. This expansion persisted until the retaliatory crusades of Christians managed to stop the spread.  \\n  \\r\\nEarly Christians used the gospel and preaching to convert  \\r\\nEarly Muslims used force to convert  \\n  \\r\\nI anxiously await my Opponents response to these points   \n",

Also, ibn Ishaq's biography was not written from empirical data, but only from oral accounts, so I will ignore that as well. Why? First, I said to use the Qur'an only. That was a ground rule! Second, it's hearsay, so it doesn't prove anything. Lastly, you know that Muhammad wouldn't go against the Qur'an, so you must respect the ground rules of this debate and try to show that the Qur'an itself supposedly commanded him to do the heinous things you've listed.  \\n  \\r\\n1) \"this will be the easiest debate yet\"  \\n  \\r\\nDon't count your chickens before they hatch.  \\n  \\r\\n2) \"Do you worship him?\"  \\n  \\r\\nMuslims don't worship prophets.  \\n  \\r\\n3) \"Is he your savior?\"  \\n  \\r\\nNo. And just by your asking me those questions, you're showing an enormous lack of knowledge of my religion. I don't need to answer the next question, since it's premised on my saying \"yes\" to the foregoing.  \\n  \\r\\n4) \"His followers are still doing his bidding today, exactly as he did\"  \\n  \\r\\nGod's followers are doing God's bidding, which is good works. The term \"Muhammad's followers\" is a misnomer and would not refer to true Muslims at all. Strictly speaking, no Muslim *follows* Muhammad, only God.  \\n  \\r\\n5) \"they (the terrorists)are the \"good Muslims\"\"  \\n  \\r\\nFalse. [5:32] \"For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever slays a soul, unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land, it is as though he slew all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our messengers came to them with clear arguments, but even after that many of them certainly act extravagantly in the land.\"  \\n  \\r\\n6) Saudi Quote. Breaking the ground rules again. I don't care what others say, even if they claim to be Muslim scholars. I only care what the Qur'an says.  \\n  \\r\\n7) You quoted verse 5:51 in the Qur'an, which allegedly says: 5:51 (\"O believers, do not hold Jews and Christians as your allies. They are allies of one another; and anyone who makes them his friends is one of them.\") \"Allies\" is a mistranslation. The word is <'awliyaa'>, which means \"protectors.\" The context is wartime. The enemy are the pagans who are trying to crush the Muslims. The Qur'an was instructing Muslims not to run for the Jews and Christians for protection. They must stand up for themselves against the attacks instead. What would the Torah have instructed to the Israelites on this matter? \"Run to the Persians cuz they'll protect you\"?  \\n  \\r\\n8) Quote: \"Qur'an 2:10 \"As for those who deny Islam...they shall be the fa**ots for the Fire of Hell.\"\"  \\n  \\r\\nI didn't realize you could just make up stuff when trying to quote something! Look up that verse for yourself. It says: \"In their hearts is a disease; and Allah has increased their disease: And grievous is the penalty they (incur), because they are false (to themselves).\" \"They\" in this verse is referring to    which are the pagans who are trying to kill the Muslims.  \\n  \\r\\n9) Quote: \"Qur'an 33:26 \"Allah made the Jews leave their homes by terrorizing them so that you killed some and made many captive. And He made you inherit their lands, their homes, and their wealth. He gave you a country you had not traversed before.\" Once again, you misquoted the Qur'an very badly. The correct quote: \"And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye made captive some.\" This refers to the People of the Book who aid the kaafiruun.  \\n  \\r\\n10) Here's 47:4 in the correct translation. Stop cutting and pasting from prophetofdoom.com. It only destroys your credibility. Qur'an [47:4] \"Now when ye meet in battle those who are kaafiruun, then it is striking at the necks until, when ye have routed them, making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.\"  \\n  \\r\\nThe correct translation speaks for itself. Interesting that the Arabic word \"jihad\" doesn't appear at all in that verse. Anyway, this verse is clearly meant for times of war against those who were seeking to destroy the small community that made up the fledgling religion.  \\n  \\r\\n11) Muhammad's Life. \"According to the Hadith and Qur'an...\" - Breaking the ground rules again. We aren't talking about the Hadith, remember? \"Muhammad and his henchmen plundered their way to power and prosperity.\" - Tell me where it says that in the Qur'an.  \\n  \\r\\n\"The five oldest and most trusted Islamic sources\" - Breaking the ground rules again. But what are these \"five oldest\" sources? Answer that question, despite your having plagiarized this. \"They reveal that he was a thief, a liar, an assassin, a pedophile, a womanizer, a rapist, a mass murderer, a pirate, a warmonger, and a scheming and ruthless politician. It's hardly the character profile of a religious leader.\" - Show me evidence of this in the Qur'an.  \\n  \\r\\nIbn Ashraf was killed because he was gathering for an uprising against Muhammad. He was planning an attack to kill that small community of Muslims. And even so, this is hearsay, someone's interpretation of what happened. No eye-witness ever wrote anything down to suggest that this happened, but if it did, it was wartime. Same goes with the other dude.  \\n  \\r\\n12) What is in the Qur'an. I'll look past the fact that you got this off of <  http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com...   > under the comments section. But since you did plagiarize someone else's writing, you'll have to explain it. Why are the creation accounts \"dimwitted to the point of being delirious?\" You made an accusation with nothing to back it up. And because the Qur'an doesn't exactly tell the same thing as the Bible, does that make it false? How does that have *anything* to do with *anything*? As far as the order of the suwar, that's not the order of the revelation, and it doesn't matter. Each sura has a reason for being there and has a story to say. And can you tell me what that verse is that \"Muslims don't want it translated?\"  \\n  \\r\\nSo far, almost your entire argument has been copy/paste off of the following sites. You should be wise not to do this as it only destroys your credibility.  \\n  \\n  http://groups.google.com...  \\n  http://www.prophetofdoom.net...  \\n  http://www.prophetofdoom.net...  \\n  http://www.prophetofdoom.net...  \\n  http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com...   \n",

Those resources being anti-Islamic hate sites. Your abuse will not be entertained, I assure you. Technically, I should only take one more Qur'anic verse since I told you to give me five of the WORST ones you could find so I could educate you about them. But what you are giving me are hardly even questionable. All it takes is to get a correct translation to prove my point.  \\n  \\r\\n1) Ali Sina. You just quoted a bunch of unsupported accusations. They do not merit a response.  \\n  \\r\\n2) Quote: \"you say Craig Winn horribly misinteprets the Qu-ran , but your translations are pretty much the same as his, and you make mountains out of molehills in trying to parse words and make KILL AND ENSLAVE THE JEWS! mean anything but\"  \\n  \\r\\nActually, quite the opposite. I have proved why these verses are there, what the real translations are, the nuances of the Arabic and what that means to the quote, and ultimately, why that certain quote is not sufficient in proving Islam is bad.  \\n  \\r\\n3) Plagiarizing. Quote: \"and you also make much of my quoting other scholars, as if that is some black mark, but this is NOT SCHOOL, and there ARE NO RULES HERE other than the basic no insults etc.\"  \\n  \\r\\nPlagiarizing shows that you cannot come up with arguments on your own. You can take others ideas, but if you plagiarize, especially in the manner in which you have, then you make accusations which you cannot support and, when I pull out the fatal flaws in them, you cannot defend against. Furthermore, your plagiarism is borderline pathological since (1) you cannot stop, and (2) you see no problem in continuing.  \\n  \\r\\n4) Qur'anic quotes.  \\n  \\r\\nAll of the following quotes first state the first part of what you believed the translation to be (I don't have enough room to put the entire quote) and then state the much more precise translation. As an added bonus, the words \"alladhina kafaru\" have been added beside the part of the translation that is referring to those who reject and seek to destroy Islam, and the quotes all refer to wartime. Additionally, the word \"hypocrites\" is not accurately translated. The real word is closer to \"traitor.\" They are basically people who claim to side with the Muslims, then turn their backs and work for the \"kafaru.\" The word it says in the Qur'an is is \"minafiqun.\"  \\n  \\r\\n8:12 \"I shall terrorize the infidels. So wound...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (8:12): \"When thy Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve [alladhina kafaru]. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.\"  \\n  \\r\\n8:57 \"If you gain mastery over them in battle, inflict...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (8:57): \"If thou comest on them [alladhina kafaru] in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.\"  \\n  \\r\\n33:26 \"Allah made the Jews leave their homes...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (33:26): \"And He brought those of the People of the Scripture who supported them [alladhina kafaru] down from their strongholds, and cast panic into their hearts. Some ye slew, and ye made captive some.\"  \\n  \\r\\n33:36 - You actually list two different passages for this one verse.  \\r\\nFirst: \"It is not fitting for a Muslim man or woman...\"  \\r\\nAnd then: 33:36 \"No Muslim has any choice after Allah...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (33:36): \"And it becometh not a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His messenger have decided an affair (for them), that they should (after that) claim any say in their affair; and whoso is rebellious to Allah and His messenger, he verily goeth astray in error manifest.\"  \\n  \\r\\nYou cannot argue against God or Muhammad. Big deal. In Christianity, you cannot argue against God or Jesus.  \\n  \\r\\n33:56 \"Allah and His angels shower blessings...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (33:56): \"Lo! Allah and His angels shower blessings on the Prophet. O ye who believe! Ask blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation.\"  \\n  \\r\\nThere's no problem here. Muslims respect the prophet, we do not worship him.  \\n  \\r\\n33:57 \"Those who speak negatively of Allah and His Apostle shall be cursed.\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (33:57): \"Lo! those who malign Allah and His messenger, Allah hath cursed them in the world and the Hereafter, and hath prepared for them the doom of the disdained.\"  \\n  \\r\\nNothing wrong with cursing those who malign God and Muhammad. Why would any Muslim do that? Why would any Christian do that to Jesus or God?  \\n  \\r\\n33:60 \"Truly, if the Hypocrites stir up sedition...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (33:60-61): \"If the hypocrites [al-munafiqun], and those in whose hearts is a disease, and the alarmists in the city do not cease, We verily shall urge thee on against them, then they will be your neighbours in it but a little while. Accursed, they will be seized wherever found and slain with a (fierce) slaughter.\"  \\n  \\r\\nNot only does it refer to al-munafiqun, but it is also \"if they do not cease.\"  \\n  \\r\\n47:3 \"Little do you remember My warning. How many towns...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (47:3): \"That is because those who disbelieve [alladhina kafaru] follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for mankind.\"  \\n  \\r\\n49:1 \"Believers, be not forward in the presence...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (49:1-3): \"O ye who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His messenger, and keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower. O ye who believe! Lift not up your voices above the voice of the Prophet, nor shout when speaking to him as ye shout one to another, lest your works be rendered vain while ye perceive not. Lo! they who subdue their voices in the presence of the messenger of Allah, those are they whose hearts Allah hath proven unto righteousness. Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward.\"  \\n  \\r\\nWhy would any Muslim want to disrespect the Prophet by raising his voice over his? Why would a Muslim shout at the Prophet? Respect toward the Prophet is required.  \\n  \\r\\n59:2 \"It was Allah who drove the [Jewish] People...\"  \\n  \\r\\n>>>Pickthal's translation (59:2): \"He it is Who hath caused those of the People of the Scripture who disbelieved [alladhina kafaru] to go forth from their homes unto the first exile. Ye deemed not that they would go forth, while they deemed that their strongholds would protect them from Allah. But Allah reached them from a place whereof they recked not, and cast terror in their hearts so that they ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So learn a lesson, O ye who have eyes!\"  \\n  \\r\\nThis is basically saying that they cannot hide from God.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have yet to prove anything, Solarman. You are being defeated through your constant plagiarism, horrible translations, and false reasoning.   \n",

did not provide a definition of \"makes more sense\" in his opening statement, although the term is vague and could have many different meanings and criteria. I took that step in my first round and defined \"makes more sense\" and then built my arguments based on that.  More Sensible(makes more sense):   Having or showing more good sense or judgment[1].  It is now clear that Pro is rejecting the importance of good evidence as a necessary basis for good judgment, but simply arguing that his religion personally makes sense to him, while atheism doesn't. His resolution is self-defeating, subjective and untenable as one can use a similar approach and say that \"apples make more sense than oranges, as there are things about apples which I understand and things about oranges which I don't.\"  If Pro wants to debate that resolution, then he should concede this debate and start another one that does explain his definition of \"makes more sense\" from Round 1.  Pro argues,   \"No it is not sensible to not believe in something when you don't have a good reason not too... if somebody knocked on the door, and you came to open it and you find nobody, and you ask your self, but someone knocked on the door the door can't knock it self,\"  Rebuttal:   What Pro gets wrong is that a knock on the door is a good reason to suspect that someone is behind the door. To draw further on this analogy, it is \"nonsensical\" to believe someone is behind the door without any good evidence(e.g doorbell, knock). Islam so far is \"nonsensical\" as it was not supported with good evidence.   REBUTTAL  Necessary conditions for a miracle-claim:  (C1) Revealed knowledge cannot exist before Mohammad's time.  (C2) Revealed knowledge cannot be scientifically inaccurate.  (C3) Qur'anic verses cannot be subjectively and wrongly interpreted.  (C4) Interpretation cannot commit the fallacy of the excluded middle or the Texas Sharpshooter logical fallacy.  Moon has borrowed light miracle-claim  Violation of C1:   Anaxagoras(400-500BC) asserted centuries before the Qur'an was revealed that: ”The moon does not have its own light, but light from the sun.”[2] This knowledge was also known by Thales centuries before that[3].  Big Bang miracle claim  Qur'anic verse:   \"Have not those who disbelieve known that   the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them  ...\"  Violation of C4:   The Qur'an says no such thing as the Big Bang but speaks of parting the actual Earth and the heavens. The Earth didn't exist at the time of the Big Bang.  Violation of C1:    In Sumerian literature which precedes the Qur'an, we find the same claim in the   Epic of Gilgamesh  : “When the heavens had been separated from the earth, when the earth had been delimited from the heavens...”[4]  Seven-skies miracle claim  Pro claims   that the Qur'an's seven skies are the sky, solar system and the Big bang.  Violation of C4:   This is a classic example of a Texas Sharpshooter fallacy: A logical fallacy in which pieces of information that have no relationship to one another are called out for their similarities[5]. How are the Big Bang and the solar system skies?  Sun's orbit miracle-claim  Violation of C1:   Hipparchus(190–120 BC) described with precision the elliptical orbits of the sun, and Babylonian astronomy, centuries before   Hipparchus,   spoke of the sun's orbit[6,7].  ...  Pro then gives   many reasons I found irrelevant to the topic like \"Muslims cannot eat pork\" and \"Women in Islam wear Hijab\".   SUMMARY  I've argued throughout this debate that agnostic atheism makes more sense than Islam, Christianity and Judaism as it shows a better sense of judgment based on the burden proof and insufficiency of evidence in Pro's position. Pro, on the other hand, has failed to provide good support for his position further proving my case.  [Citations in the comment section]   \n",

God has accepted slavery. But what kind of slavery? I have no idea how slavery is in Christianity. But I tell you about the rights of slaves in Islam. I'll post a comment for your second argument.  \\n  \\r\\n1. The sense of brotherhood  \\r\\nIslam has created a notion that both master and slave were brothers, one to the other, by inculcating an awareness that all men were created by the same God and were the children of the same parents,\"O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.\" (Quran 49:13)  \\r\\nGod has cut apart the very root of all forms of narrow mindedness that arose out of the feelings of superior birth.  \\r\\nThe prophet had taught that righteousness wasn't measured on the basis of color, race or wealth, but on the basis of God-fearing alone. \"The Arab has no superiority over the non-Arab or the non-Arab over the Arab; the white over the black or the black over the white except in the matter of God-fearing.\"  \\r\\nWhere slaves are mentioned, God remarked that \"You are of one another.\" (4:25) He makes it clear that both master and slave are brothers and that it is circumstances alone which force slavery upon some people.  \\n  \\r\\n2. An awareness concerning the rights of the slave  \\r\\nThe slave was a mere commodity item in all ancient societies. His lot was confined to duties alone. His obligation was simply to strive for an increase in the comforts and luxury enjoyed by the master and in this regard, there was to be no compromise whatsoever. It was a paramount necessity that the slave was in good shape in order to be able to work for his master. The slaves were housed in yards which sufficed to accommodate not even the cattle and other livestock. As for the clothes that they were provided with, they were sufficient not even to cover their nakedness.  \\r\\nIslam brought about a transformation in the situation. It taught that slave had rights as well. The prophet said:\"They are your brothers and relatives. Let each one provide for the brother under him with the food that he himself eats and with the clothes that he himself wears. Place not upon them any task that is overbearing for them. If you do assign them a difficult task, you must help them in its execution.\"  \\r\\nThe duty of the slave, in primitive societies, was never confined to mere labour. He was also doomed to be at the receiving end of his master\"s sadistic pleasure-seekings. To be always ready to kill and to be killed for the sake of his master\"s pleasure. God ordered that such a state of affairs must change. It instructed in the humane and proper treatment of the slaves.\" Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good,\"and to relatives, orphans, the needy, ..., the companion at your side, the traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful.\" (4:36)  \\r\\nThe prophet said:\"If anyone kills a slave, we shall kill him. If anyone maims a slave, we shall maim him as well. If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him.\"  \\r\\nFrom being the choice commodity for the master\"s choicest desire, the slave was being transformed into a being with his very own personality and rights. It was in a society in which existed the heinous practice of castrating slaves that the prophet had, in the most unambiguous terms, declared that the master who castrates his slave will, in turn, \"be castrated by us.\" The slaves were castrated in order that their sexual impulses be destroyed, whereby, they could then be made to work like animals. Islam, which prohibited this practice, particularly instructs that means should be made available for the satisfaction of the sexual instincts of the slave also. \"Marry those among you who are single, and the virtuous ones among your slaves, male or female: if they are in poverty, Allah will give them means out of His grace: for Allah is Ample-giving, and He knows all things.\" (24:32)  \\r\\nGod also prohibited the system of forcing female slaves into prostitution. \"But let them who find not the means for marriage abstain from sexual relations until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract for eventual emancipation from among whom your right hands possess - then make a contract with them if you know there is within them goodness and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire chastity, to seek thereby the temporary interests of worldly life. And if someone should compel them, then indeed, Allah is to them, after their compulsion, Forgiving and Merciful.\"(24:33)  \\r\\nThe Prophet taught against even uttering anything that might injure the self-respect of the slave. The prophet had made it clear that the slave, too, enjoyed self-respect upon which none had the right to trespass.  \\r\\nIslam teaches that the slave has the right to become even a leader and that in the event that he does get appointed as a leader, it is obligatory to obey him. \"Even if it be a negro slave, with hair like dried grapes, who is appointed as your leader, you must hear and obey him.\"  \\r\\n\"Seat him behind thee for he is thy brother and it is the same soul as yours that is within him.\"  \\n  \\r\\nIslam gave new meaning to the relation between master and slave by insisting that the master and the slave both had the same soul. It is true, nevertheless, that the slave does fall under the jurisdiction of the master. However, the master is duty-bound to fulfill the rights of the slave. It is his duty to meet the slave\"s requirements of food, clothing, sexual gratification and so on. The slave is never to be harmed. He shouldn't be put into difficulty by entrusting him with burdensome tasks as well. In such fashion did Islam create a revolution of sorts in raising the slave, for the first time in history, to the position of a free man.  \\r\\nIt was through this way that it became possible for Islam to bridge the wide gap that existed between the mental states of the master and the slave. The end result of this revolution was that the owner was emancipated from the belief that the slave was a commodity on which could be carried out his choicest desire while the slave was freed of the notion that he was doomed to a fate in which he was to bear, and to be patient and labouring always.  \\n  \\r\\n3. Declared the emancipation of slaves to be an act of righteousness.  \\r\\nBy declaring the slave\"s to be an existence which had rights of its own, Islam had made slavery non-existent. Without stopping at that point, however, it went further by turning to a course of action which would, in time, serve to eliminate the system in a very practical sense indeed. This practical step which Islam had adopted to make slavery virtually non-existent was its act of declaring the emancipation of slaves to be an act of righteousness.  \\r\\nGod said:\"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered\" prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them. So they who have believed in him,honored him supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful.\" (7:157)  \\r\\nThis verse which makes it clear that the emancipation of slaves is an act of the highest virtue goes as follows:\" What can make you know what is breaking through the difficult pass? It is the freeing of a slave or feeding on a day of severe hunger. An orphan of near relationship or a needy person in misery.\" (90:12-16)  \\r\\nAs far as the emancipation of slaves was concerned, the prophet had exhorted his companions towards it by making an example himself. He set free the slaves who were in his possession.  \\r\\nThere are numerous sayings of the prophet which encourage the freeing of slaves. \"If anyone sets free a believing slave, each of his body parts will be set free from Hell so much so that it will be the hand for a hand, the leg for a right up to the sexual organ for the sexual organ.\"  \\r\\nOnce, the Prophet was asked:\"Which is the highest act in the emancipation of slaves?\" he replied, \"To set free the most valuable slave of the master.\"  \\r\\nHe, while talking about those who become deserving of God\"s reward twice, said, \"He who confers a proper behavior upon the female slave under him, then gives her the best education, sets her free and then marries her will become entitled to a double reward.\"  \\n  \\r\\n4. Emancipation of slaves was made the act of expiation for many types of sin  \\r\\nIn addition to encouraging the believers towards its commission by declaring the emancipation of slaves to be a virtuous deed, Islam recommended it as an act of expiation for many types of sin. The atonement for sins like unintentional murder and breaking one\"s vow of not approaching his wife was the freeing of one slave. As for those who were not ready to free slaves in expectation of God's reward alone, the command which made the emancipation of slaves an atoning act for sins committed, nevertheless, made it necessary for them to do so.   \n",
       "505813  \\n  \\r\\nYou arrogant Xtians know nothing. YOUR see here, I can quote what's written, Therefore the text means as I believe it to intend - haughty none sense. Dude the Middle Ages have long sensed past into oblivion. You arrogant xtian fools no longer have a sword at the throat of the Jewish people!  \\n  \\r\\nYour vile translations of the Hebrew T'NaCH merit total and utter contempt. Ignorant bore, The Books of the Prophets never had chapters and verses - that's an Xtian addition. All logic stands upon the foundation of Order. The \"organization\" of the Books of the Prophets N E V E R spun around the artificially imposed Xtian none sense religion. The Books of the NaCH/Prophets and Holy Writings/ operates around a completely different Order arrangement - known as sugiot.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Talmud, Codified in about 450CE also follows the tradition of sugiot Order. Your horrid and despicable dead religion A) totally ignored the arranged Order of the NaCH literature and B) therefore remains totally oblivious to the Oral Torah logic system revealed at Sinai 40 days after the sin of the Golden Calf wherein Israel thinking that Moshe the prophet had died demanded from Aaron a Way for post Moshe Israel to systematically and logically interpret the Written Torah - the Constitution of the Republic.  \\n  \\r\\nBy contrast, Your dead despicable religion perverted the T'NaCH literature to fit as their Old Testament in this horrid new religion which worships the imaginary myth Jesus son of Zeus as God. Isaiah as a prophet has no power to over rule or contradict the Torah Constitution. Like duh!  \\n  \\r\\nHillel HaGadol, Or Hillel HaZaken, Also known as Hillel HaBavli: born, According to tradition, In Babylon c. 110 BCE, Died 10 CE in Jerusalem) a Jewish Torah scholar and leader; his instruction on how to interpret the Torah stands to this day as once of the most influential figures in all of Jewish history. Hillel taught Jewish logic. The Oral Torah which the Xtian idiot church denies, Logic. Both the NaCH and the Talmud codifications exist based upon this unique logic system which the evil morons of Xtianity deny.  \\n  \\r\\nHillel stream lined his rules of logic by which to interpret the Masoret/Traditions sealed by the fore fathers of Israel - Torah Prophets Writings Talmud Midrash Siddur - the Sages of Israel sealed these texts, Therein giving all generations of the Jewish people an identical Masoret/Tradition, By which to build faith.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Xtian fool translators, In their zeal to translate the rejected T'NaCH of the Jews - they call it to this day \"old testament' - these babbling idiots organized the Books of the T'NaCH literature in a way that suited their tastes and interests. Order changes how a person thinks and perceives reality. For example the letters which make the word God, If re arranged make also make the word Dog! Such subtleties the Xtian brain dead translators totally ignored.  \\n  \\r\\nHillel the Elder based his 7 rules of logical interpretation on the assumption that Jews - forget the Goyim, Torah instruction does not apply to these foreign aliens b/c Goyim to this very day never accepted the Torah revelation at Sinai. You outsiders looking in only know how to jabber \"about\" a topic; fools of your kind never attempt to learn \"through\" a subject.  \\n  \\r\\nDeductive and Inductive logic requires the skill to make comparisons and contrasts. The formal study of any literature operates by making \"measured\" comparisons and contrasts. Brain dead Goyim love to read their bibles, But virtually never attempt to learn that literature as a formal discipline. The inflated egotism of Goyim, Perhaps best summed up as: \"DO NOT CONFUSE ME WITH THE FACTS. . . I HAVE MY PERSONAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS! \" Religion for Xtians, \"do you personally believe brother! \" Faith of fools revolves around the ego of I. The first word of Xtian belief systems - irregardless of the creed Catholic or Protestant- the word I. I -- has nothing to do with objective logic. In fact I -- perverts all logic by skewing its results in favor of I.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Talmud stands upon the foundations of T'NaCH. Duh. The Talmud exists as a Common Law codification of Jewish law. Therefore the T'NaCH functions upon the exact same principle upon which stands all Common Law legal systems - precedents! This means, That for a person to learn a \"sugia\" of NaCH, Formal learning - based upon Jewish logic - absolutely requires a measured comparison of a sugia of NaCH to similar sugiot of NaCH.  \\n  \\r\\nHillel's hermeneutics stand upon 7 basic rules. Its called the fundamentals, Of learning how to learn.  \\r\\n1. M30;al (M31;ol) wa-M17;omer: \"Argumentum a minori ad majus\" or \"a majori ad minus\"; corresponding to the scholastic proof a fortiori.  \\r\\n2. Gezerah shawah: Argument from analogy. Biblical passages containing synonyms or homonyms are subject, However much they differ in other respects, To identical definitions and applications.  \\r\\n3. Binyan ab mi-katub eM17;ad: Application of a provision found in one passage only to passages which are related to the first in content but do not contain the provision in question.  \\r\\n4. Binyan ab mi-shene ketubim: The same as the preceding, Except that the provision is generalized from two Biblical passages.  \\r\\n5. Kelal u-PeraM89; and PeraM89; u-kelal: Definition of the general by the particular, And of the particular by the general.  \\r\\n6. Ka-yoN27;e bo mi-maM31;om aM17;er: Similarity in content to another Scriptural passage.  \\r\\n7. Dabar ha-lamed me-'inyano: Interpretation deduced from the context.  \\n  \\r\\nThese basic Amendments to the 13 middot of Oral Torah logic which Moshe the Prophet orally heard at Horev 40 on the Day of Atonement, According to Hillel interpreting the Written Torah requires total reliance upon Jewish schools of logic and totally excludes the classic ancient Greek philosophy of logic taught by Plato and Aristotle.  \\n  \\r\\nYou puff up your vain ego by quoting from Isaiah 53, As if Jews never before read those p'sukim/verses. Idiot. Based upon the logic of #6. & #7. , I introduce the following Amendment to these logical rules. (1) Oral Torah middot which Moshe the prophet originally heard on Mr. Horev (2) by making a comparison of one sugia of NaCH, Specifically in this case Isaiah to other sugiot of Isaiah containing the identical Oral Torah middot. Based upon the rule: learn the Torah by means of bringing close precedents.  \\n  \\r\\nThe sugia of Isaiah which contains the specific verses which you quoted starts [employing your chapter/verse system] 52:12 to 53:12. This Order of sugiot patterns the Written Torah which has an organization around sugiot. The Written Torah serves as a precedent for how the Books of the Prophets organized their Order. The sugia which you quote specific verses therefrom contains 4 Oral Torah middot. [Its not my purpose to teach Oral Torah to a foreign alien outsider like yourself. Therefore the specific names of these 4 middot shall I shall not list].  \\n  \\r\\nNow employing the search for a valid precedent [T'NaCH stands upon the principle of Common Law. Common Law stands upon precedents], I must locate other sugiot which contain these identical 4 middot. The premise works like this: if i throw a 2lb rock into a still body of water, The ripple effect produced by the impact of the stone upon the tranquil waters. . . That if i take this identical stone and throw it upon a separate tranquil body of water, That this stone shall produce as similar ripple effect. Therefore, By this premise, If i find other sugiot of Isaiah which contain these exact same middot as found in the sugia from which you quoted, Then the 2nd \"witness\" from Isaiah give me the depth by which i can comprehend the intent of the sugia from which you quoted. Meaning I have found a valid close precedent permitting me to interpret the intent of the Framer of our sugia in question.  \\n  \\r\\nIt took about 2 minutes to locate another sugia in the Book of Isaiah which contains these exact 4 Oral Torah middot which the God of Israel orally communicated to the prophet Moshe on Yom Kippor/the day of Atonement/ 40 days following the sin of the Golden Calf. The sugia: 26:1 to 26:10.  \\n  \\r\\nEarlier when asked by you about the meaning of Isaiah 53, My response: that it referred to Israel in exile. I shall now amend that explanation by adding the comparison to the Jews of Germany and Europe during the horror years of the Nazi 3rd Reich. Three years after the 1000 year Reich stood in total ruins and destruction, The inferior race slaughtered by the European sub human barbarians stood nose to nose with 5 Arab armies aided by Britain and defeated them in war. The Europeans experienced total shock! How could a people whom these same European monsters murdered 75% of European Jewry, 3 years later totally crush 5 Arab armies aided with the military assistance of Britain? !  \\n  \\r\\nFor over 2000 years Jews endured the taunts of Xtians, Prayers made every Easter, Followed by a pogrom, For the \"perfidious\" or \"treacherous\" Jews! The wicked vile scum church declared that the cursed Jews must forever wander the earth as despised and abhorred exiles for the sin of killing God.  \\n  \\r\\nJustice! Now Jews rule our own country and the evil wicked church stands in total exile - waiting for the 2nd coming of jesus son of Zeus! Goyim Xtians have to portion in the Torah/T'NaCH faith. When they die, Their bodies feed the worms, Because they have not now or ever any portion into the world to come. They pray to a mythical imaginary man/god and we Jews have mocked these ignorant arrogant stupid scum bag fools for over 2000 years!   \n",

Saudi Arabia holds the worlds largest reserve of crude oil and also happens to be our top provider, certainly a country that has nothing to gain by damaging U.S. relations.\"  This is a tactic referred to in Islam as \"taqiya\" and maruna, and the overall foundation of their tactic is called \"stealth jihad\".  Taqiya is to lie about your identity or loyalty to destroy your enemy from within.  The Prophet of Islam, Muhammed, said, \"War is deceit\".  https://islamqa.info...  ----  Islam wants the West in chaos-  Black Lives Matter are not African Americans in the sense of being the descendents of the slaves. They are the descendents of Islam.   The founder of BLM? Muslim  http://www.barenakedislam.com...  Dallas cop killer? Islam  http://m.clarionproject.org...  Baton Rouge cop killer? Islam  https://news.vice.com...  ---  The general construct of this philosophy is:  1)Become the citizens of the nations considered non-Muslim     2)Outbreed them.   3)become their influential people, such as tv personalities, politicians, etc.  4)Destroy them from the inside. In this case it is:  A)Break them financially.  B)Put them in a state of fear  C)Use political correctness and liberal politics against them. Use freedom to destroy freedom.  QUOTE:  Walid Shoebat, ex Muslim-  \"What the West does not understand about Islamism is that Jihad is very systematic. It has stages. If Muslims have the upper hand, then Jihad is waged by force. If Muslims do not have the upper hand, then Jihad is waged through financial and political means. Since Muslims do not have the upper hand in America or Europe, they talk about peace in front of you while supporting Hamas and Hezbollah in the back room.

       "      <td>\\n  \\n  \\n  Thanks Con.        Opening Argument:  C1) Building Collapse      I'll begin by directly addressing the three towers at the WTC   that were brought down, specifically the two main towers that had two   separate passenger airliners enter each of them; with the   American Airlines Flight 11   flying into the North Tower and   United Airlines Flight 175   flying into the South, and the third Tower [Tower 7] simply coming down on its own   without   any plane crashing into it or any external components. It should come as no surprise that all three towers that came down at the World Trade center were considerably well-made , these buildings were specifically made to withstand pressure--and the event of a plane[s] crashing into them, given their height which stood at 1,368 and 1,368 feet--making them the world's largest buildings. For two such buildings to suddenly come down at a free-fall speed in fact defies basic physics and never has anything remotely similar happened before or after 9/11.   \\n  \\n  The only explanation for the fall of all three towers is controlled demolition, something that can even easily be seen in captured footage--and in comparisons made to other examples of controlled demolitions. Both the North and South Tower showed no sign of falling down   and instead were withstanding the steady flames inside; before suddenly as the one hour mark was approaching, the North Tower dramatically collapsed after being followed by the South. The point of the Tower 7 should again be highlighted, as this was the tower that absolutely   no   plane enter it and would've easily been able to withstand any outside pressures.     C2) Thermite Explosives and Witness Testimony   Another striking piece of evidence is traces of Nano-thermite found in dust samples and molten metal that was found from all three towers—the only reasonable explanation for this is once again, a controlled demolition in which explosives were planted in the Twin towers. North and South collapse from the top which suggests explosives were placed in the top floors of the buildings, while Tower 7 collapses at ground level; meaning that explosives were placed at the very bottom. Witnesses and survivors of 9/11 have all stated that they heard numerous explosions coming from within the buildings, directly before they fell at free-fall speed; which was well under 10 seconds.         Again, why exactly would all three buildings have traces of Nano-thermite in them and why would there be explosions? On the basis of two planes crashing into the towers, they would not occur.   C3) Removal of Evidence   \\n  \\n  Instead of examining it and inquiring as to why three supremely well-structured buildings completely collapsed at free-fall speed, the evidence was promptly removed and not examined. The structural steel from the tower was specifically the most important piece of evidence—as it could’ve shown exactly why the buildings collapsed which they should not have. Additional evidence that has been destroyed are tapes that were recorded by     around six air traffic controllers who handledhijackings on 9/11/01. This doesn’t stop at the WTC either, after the Pentagon crash officials began immediately to remove all evidence. Naturally this wouldn't’t be an issue if any evidence was presented of the entire 9/11 attacks   but it never was. This lack of transparency from the U.S government led to many experts calling for a proper investigation to the 9/11, particularly at the WTC.   C4) Pentagon Crash  \\n  \\n  One of the major errors here is how exactly a 38 metre and 13,5 metres high passenger plane could only leave a hole that is 5 metres wide; obviously this is implausible. In addition, every passenger plane crash in history has left debris including large parts of the plane itself, where as no real debris was found at the exact place the plane went   into. Given that the plane was supposed to be a Boeing 757, it also would’ve entirely smashed the surrounding windows. There is no way that the wings of such a plane could not demolish them. Another fact is that there were 86 cameras all around the Pentagon building, yet only one camera was used to display footage of the plane and this shows invariably nothing; neither the plane entering the building. Being a passenger plane, the Boeing 757 was also not made to go fast at such a low level [I.E ground] or make quick manoeuvres in the air.        \\n  \\n  The Pentagon airspace is in fact the most protected airspace in the world, so how is that a jet was able to enter it without any deterrence? Any unidentified planes would be observed and dealt with immediately  .   C5) False Terrorist Link     Perhaps one of the most important aspects to the 9/11 Hoax is the terrorist link. The official U.S government version is that a total of 19 Arab terrorists managed to attack three separate buildings, the North and South Towers in New York, and the Pentagon--apparently all at the command of Osama Bin Laden who was accused as the main suspect by the U.S. The first issue in this is the fact that he never made the U.S most wanted list specifically for being responsible for 9/11. Osama never officially confessed to orchestrating the attacks and instead strongly denied all responsibility in 2001, stating that as Muslim he is   \"strictly forbidden\"   to   \"cause harm to innocent women and children\".    Videos released by the U.S clearly show that the men within them are   not   Osama, due to the differences in physical appearances   and   apparently age.      Moving to the other 19 accused terrorists, it should be highlighted that many  of them are in fact   alive  . These include   Abdul Aziz Al-Omari, he was quoted in 2001 as saying to British Newspaper the Telegraph:     “I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list. They gave my name and my  date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane. I had nothing to do with this.”  This presents the question of how exactly can a man can fly a plane into the World Trade Center, miraculously survive, escape authorities, and then somehow make it back to Saudi Arabia a few days later?   Another was Saeed Al-Ghamdi, accused of being aboard flight, who also reported to the Telegraph  in 2001:      “  I was completely shocked. For the past 10 months I have been based in Tunis  with 22 other pilots learning to fly an Airbus 320. The FBI provided no evidence of my presumed involvement in the attacks.”  So rather than flying a plane into the WTC this man was also in the Middle East at the exact  time 9/11 took place. Now onto Waleed Al-Shehri, the Daily Trust reported in 2001 that:      “His [Al-Shehri] photograph was released by the FBI, and has been shown in newspapers and on television around the world. That same Mr Al-Shehri has turned up in Morocco, proving clearly that he was not a member of the suicide attack.”         Note that the U.S still categorized them as culprits and continued with their \"suicide bomber\" status even  after these statements were released and they were found to be alive in the Middle East.   Another so-called suicide bomber of the plane that crashed into Pennsylvania, Ahmed Al-Nami, also stated in 2001 in his defence:      \"I’m still alive, as you can see. I was shocked to see my name mentioned by the American Justice Department. I had never even heard of Pennsylvania where the plane I was supposed to have hijacked.”   The BBC additionally reported in 2001:      “Another of the men named by the FBI as a hijacker n the suicide attacks on Washington and New York has turned up alive and well.”   As well as the CNN reporting on another hijacker:  “Adnan Bukhari is still in Florida”      C6) Zionist Connection   \\n  \\n  The private property developer and former   chairman of the Jewish Appeal, Larry Silverstein, signed a lease on the WTC two months prior before the   attacks. His initial move upon buying the WTC complex was change the security  company to   Securacom, a company that George Bush’s brother happened to be the board of directors of. As well as the change in the security, Silverstein also increased the insurance policies of the complex; meaning that he was awarded a full $7,2 billion compensation after the 9/11 attacks. The fact is that the buildings were no longer financially profitable [mainly due to asbestos] and Silverstein and company actually stood a lot to gain—as well as Israel, who Silverstein regularly donates significant amounts of money to.  It also seems that Israeli’s within New York were forwarded of the attack, on September 12  th   2001 the Jerusalem Post reported:        “  The Israeli foreign ministry has collected the names of 4,000 Israelis believed to have been in the areas of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon at the time of the attack.\"     \\n   However, only one Israeli at the WTC was killed on that day; indicating that the 4,000 number is a rather large amount to have survived without any severe injury. Other pieces of evidence include Israel trying to suppress a classified report on 9/11 and the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak somehow knowing in an interview with the BBC that Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the attacks, despite the fact they’d only just happened and that no one had been formally identified.      \\n  The Zionist Connection to 9/11 connects easily to what *motives* existed. As well as financial gain for one of U.S’s most powerful Jews. There's also the War on Terror that would come soon after the attacks. Having such attacks on the U.S and a large loss of life gave the U.S   government the perfect excuse to invade the Middle East on the premise that the U.S was literally under attack by militant Islam and that peoples lives would be in danger if they did not “confront” it directly—by invading Iraq and Afghanistan.    The U.S went into Iraq with the primary aim of overthrowing, Saddam Hussein, someone who on the contrary to inciting   error actually managed to control extremist fractions within his country. Israel in particular had a lot to gain, and repeatedly advised the U.S to invade.   Sources:        http://pasted.co...        \\n</td>\n",

If you cant see that unlawful killing of doctors is not going to harm your cause then you need to wake up and look around.      \"you havent answered... do we use politics and law if people were out killing two year olds generally legally but sometimes illegally?\"    People aren't killing 2 year old legally. For your question to have any bearing the 2 year old would have to have much more in common with a fetus then your question lets on. We need apples to apples not apples to oranges. To answer your question i would have to be able to put myself in a world where a 2 year old was totally reliant on the mother only, this reliance could not be passed off to someone else, where at times the 2 year old could present a serious risk to the mother’s life. I can’t imagine such a world. So I can’t answer your question.      \"i showed witess[sic] testimony from his own workers and how he changed the measurements to determine viability... that means he did it illegally. what more do we need?\"    A court conviction. What you have put forth one can say is unethical. You need a court of law to actually say he broke the law.    \"it migght[sic] not have wroked in corut[sic] but who cares?\"    Anyone who care about the creditability of the pro-life movement should care. Plus it means he was not found guilty.      \"1 saved is enough\"   The person who shot Dr. Tiller broke the law. Had i been at that church with a gun should i have prevented that murder? One life saved is enough. The murderer was a bad person in attempting to kill and succeeding in killing Dr. Tiller. Honestly those that support the murder of doctors who perform abortions because they are \"bad people\" are no different than those who support suicide bombers because their victims are also \"Bad people\".      Dr. Tiller was in one court battle. He was acquitted. [1] I ask 2 things of Pro, please stop saying what he was doing was illegal and please capitalize his name like you have of other people in your posts. If Pro continues to misrepresent Tiller’s actions as illegal and selectively not capitalizing his name I do ask that you grant conduct points in my favor.      \"(the prolife clinic next to his had a 90% success rate.\"    Success rate of what exactly? And what happened to the other 10%?      \"he was in it for money, pure and simple.\"    Irrelevant.      \"im not against fixing social problems that cause abortions. but that dont mean we cant kill tiller etc too.   remember im not advocating all doctors just tiller, maybe carhart, and a select few.\"   I am sure the Muslim terrorist aren’t advocating killing all the westerners just the ones that disagree with them.      There is one thing I wish to thank Pro for I have decided to start donation to Planned Parenthood as a small way that I can combat the terrorist in the prolife movement.      If one looks at my profile they will see I am an atheist, but on behalf of Christians everywhere I ask Pro to change her view or change her status because when you think about killing doctors the answer to WWJD is not \"go grab my glock\".      I find Pro’s views to be deplorable and besides donating to Planned Parenthood I am going to now stop and talk with the protesters and counter protest.      if convincing me and others like me to be actively in opposition with the prolife movement is not a clear example of why killing Dr. Tiller is not good for the pro -life movement then I concede.  \\n  [1]  http://www.nytimes.com...</td>\n",

I can acknowledge that not all Syrians are Muslim. But with a crappy vetting process, or no vetting process at all, how do we know this for sure? More specifically, how do we know that the refugees coming into America are not Muslim? If we are to say, \"they are Muslim, so what?\" then how do we know they are not radicalized? WE DON'T. nd since Glorious Leader Obama refuses to vet these combat aged men (where are the widows and children he has spoken about? The vast majority are combat aged men)[1], it's better to be safe than sorry.  \\n  \\r\\nLet me ask my opponent a personal question. Going through your profile, I could not gauge whether you were, Jewish, Christian, Atheist etc. I could not gauge whether you were straight or gay. Let's assume then. Let's assume you are either Jewish, Christian or Atheist. Here is the question I would like to ask:  \\n  \\r\\n1. Do you enjoy your Judaism, Christianity, or Atheism?  \\n  \\r\\nIf you answer yes, then under Sharia Law you would be in danger if you did not convert to Islam.  \\n  \\r\\nHow does this tie in to the refugees? Simple. We simply do not know what these people want. Do they have an agenda? Possibly. When you look at the Koran, you see that it is VERY evident that it calls for the Islamification of the whole world. And by violent means if necessary. If these refugees were all Christian, there would be no argument, but we cannot take any chances. Not in a post 9/11 world  \\n  \\r\\nI would like to point out the story of Ronnie Smith. I knew Ronnie. He was a deacon in my church. I did not know him well, but I have talked to him on a few occasions. About two years ago, he and his wife and son were living in Lybia as he taught I belive it was physics. One day he was out for his morning run when he was gunned down. We don't know if these attackers were radicalized or what. Is that a risk we want to take on our own soil?[2]  \\n  \\r\\nAlso, regarding Sharia Law, my opponent does not seem to know what this entails. I'll let radical Muslim cleric, Adjem Choundry speak for me in this link[3]  \\n  \\r\\nFinally, Must we forget about Paris and my home town of San Bernardino? [4][5] At least in the case of the San Bernardino tragedy, we know the shooters were radicalized before coming to America.  \\n  \\r\\nI ask again, is this a something we want to risk with the refugees, with no vetting process?  \\n  \\r\\n1.   http://www.allenbwest.com...  \\r\\n2.   http://edition.cnn.com...  \\r\\n3.   http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org...  \\r\\n4.   https://en.wikipedia.org...  \\r\\n5.   http://www.latimes.com...  \\n  \\r\\nI apologize for any spelling errors, my keybord is horribly messed up</td>\n",

The 9/11 attackers blended in REALLY well for YEARS before they did what they did. It is asinine to assume that Islamic Syrian Refugees are automatically peaceful just because Supreme Leader Obama says so. This is the same thing that happened in WW2. Nazis came over to infiltrate America and join flight schools. They mastered various accents so no one would know theywere German. We figured out who they were by the way they held their cigarettes. How do we know Syrian refugees are not out to harm us? We don't. Shall we really wait until it is too late?  \\n  \\r\\n2. Christianification and Islamifcation are RADICALLY different. There is absolutely no comoparison. Islamification calls for forcible conversion or death. In rare cases, if murder does not happen to those who do not convert to Islam,they are forced to pay a special tax. Islam calls for rape of women, Islam or not. Isam calls for gays to be jailed or murdered. Christianity does none of this. Even in the scriptures quoted, there is no call to violence  \\n  \\r\\n3. A simple understanding of the teachings of the bible shows that so-called \"Radical Christians\" do not actually represent Christianity. As stated above, Islam is vastly different.  \\n  \\r\\n4.

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nFirstly i would like to thank Con for his argument, i have been waiting eagerly for his reply and have found his arguments interesting. I would like to say that in some regard i have been playing devils advocate with some of my original points...but i do believe that America are fighting in many regards an unwinnable war in the middle east.  \\r\\nOk...so Con took great issue with my definition with the concept of what the ‘war of terror' actually is. I do not believe for a moment that the debate is rendered ‘meaningless' as Con suggested due to my lack of definition of what the ‘war on terror' is....unless anyone reading this debate has been living in a box for the last 10 years then i can safely assume that we all know that the ‘war on terror' is the battle against Muslim extremism.  \\r\\nCon definition of the war on Terror was as follows.  \\r\\n‘The well-defined goal of the war on terror is to stop hostile action by terrorists against the United States. A well-defined subordinate goal is to remove safe havens wherein terrorists may devise attacks without fear of preemption.'  \\r\\nI have to say that i do not believe that this definition is rounded at all. If one looks at Cons definition it is still extremely transparent....Yes its true that we are fighting a war against terrorist...the whole of the free world is fighting the same war....Yes its true that we are trying to find their safe havens to prevent future attack.....but what i implore the readers to consider when reading Cons definition of the ‘war on terror' is its vagueness....we don't no who these terrorists are....we don't no where they come from...how they are armed and so on.....so i feel Cons definition barely scrapes the surface of a deep and complex issue.  \\r\\nAs recently as January 2009 the British foreign secretary himself claimed that the idea of a ‘war on terror' was deeply unhelpful and does more harm than good....his exact words were as follows.....  \\r\\n‘Ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken\" and later said \"Historians will judge whether [the notion] has done more harm than good\".  \\r\\nCon then went on to bizarrely compare the ‘war on terror' with the Cold War...i understand to an extent why he did this....Yes the west defeated the East...and yes to an extent the west was fighting Communist ideology...but let's not get bogged down in idealism which is what i feel Con is trying to do...look beyond your patriotic zeal and you will see that the Cold War was won due to economics not ideology....American spending power could not be matched by the Russia and its proxy states....so it folded....the fact that the Communist party is still the second largest in Russia today shows out right that it was not the lure of democracy that encouraged Russia to end the Cold War.....therefore showing you can't defeat an idea.  \\r\\nIt is also wrong to compare ‘ war on terror' to the Cold War from a geopolitical stand point....the fact is....that during the Cold War we knew exactly who we were fighting....we knew where the enemy was (primarily Russia and china and there proxy states)...we had an idea of how many weapons they had and what they wanted to achieve...but more importantly ...there was always room for negotiation...now compare this to the ambiguity of the war on terror....is there anyone here who can truly say they know where the ‘terrorists' are?....do we have exact knowledge of their strength and numbers?....do we know what they are planning to do next?....the answer is no....you cannot defeat an idea or a belief.  \\r\\nCon is ultimately playing a dangerous game by being so loose on his definitions..I believe that by simply calling people ‘terrorists' and being insular in your outlook one creates a dividing line.....we can already see it with American foreign policy...the catch phrase...'your either with us or against us'...is terribly dangerous...it effectively draws a line between America and the east and simplifies a tremendously complex issue. America needs to be clear what its goals are or it can never win its ‘war on terror.  \\r\\nCon asks me at the end of his article what i propose the alternatives are...do we just give up the struggle?.,...well i propose this question to him...how does he propose on fighting a failing war? Does he even know how groups like Al Queda are organized?....let me fill him in briefly...and it will shed light on what an impossible task we have confronting us....  \\r\\nAl queda has a central command structure like any organization ranging from financial departments, training committees even media relation committees....however Al queda is unique in that it has an outer periphery which even its leaders have no real control over...Clandestine cells exist all over the world and are organized in such a way that they work independently from Al quedas central hub....These members do not take orders from anyone...they work in Al quedas name and attack targets which they choose...how can you stop this?....what stopping me right now from setting up my own cell? The answer is nothing,,, Leonard Weinbergs book ‘Global Terrorism' sums it nicely..  \\r\\n‘Although the network of terrorist cells has an established leadership and command structure, direct approval from the top is not necessarily needed to commit an act of terrorism in al Qaeda's name. Militants operating within the al Qaeda structure are divided into small, independently operating cells. These cells may receive orders and financial support from top Qaeda lieutenants or they may raise funds and plan operations on their own'  \\r\\nAlthough i would like to expand on this point i am aware that i have a word limit....but the point here is clear...you can't monitor these terrorist groups...just look at the London Tube bombings...they acted on there own independently from any central Al queda Command....we are literally chasing shadows.  \\r\\nMy final point is as follows....I made the case in my original argument that the longer America stays in Iraq and Afghanistan the longer and more protracted the war will be....I also said that the whole reason behind Al quedas original beef with America was centred on the idea that America had trodden on Muslim soil during the First Gulf war...Con dismissed this as ‘nonsense' and regrettably exposed his lack of knowledge of this conflict....again i don't want to drift on to a long and boring explanation of the origins of the conflict but i would say this....  \\r\\nThe whole premise of Bin Ladens first attacks on America were due to its occupation of Saudi Soil...Saudi Arabia is home to Mecca and Medina the holiest sights in the Muslim world...the Vatican or the Jeruselem of the Christian world....The Saudi government rejected the offer of Bin Ladens Mujuhadin or ‘Holy Warrioirs' to protect them during the First Gulf War and instead chose the Americans without thinking of the idealogical consequences....again i defer to the words of Leonard Weinberg...  \\r\\n‘This decision infuriated Bin Laden. Not only was his offer to provide Holy Warriors rebuffed but, more galling still, the government decided to allow the Kingdom , with its Muslim holy sites at Mecca and Medina, to be used against the Infidel Americans.'  \\r\\nThe American presence in Saudi Arabia and other middle eastern locations is the seed that grew to 9/11...for Con to say that its ‘nonsense' simply shows he does not understand the complexities of the conflict...The longer America stays in Iraq and Afghanistan the worse the conflict will become...i am in no way saying that there are not those who want America to stay...but for as long as America stays the voices of extremism will drown out the moderate voices in the Islamic world..remember it is one of Alquedas original goals to expel all American and western influence from the muslim world....  \\r\\nI am running out of room but very breifly...Con has not defined what the conflict is...his cold war comparison is wrong from a geopolitical perspective...America is chasing shadows...i beleive the motion stands.</td>\n",

I also urge...no no I demand the reader to recognize that both Spain and England were (and still are) strong allies to America and were active in Iraq and Afghanistan......both were keen subscribers to American foreign policy yet both suffered domestic terrorist incidents...France and Germany are not in Iraq or Afghanistan and they have not suffered from this new terrorism.  \\n  \\r\\nTherefore i don't agree at all with Cons slightly blinded assumption that Europe is hanging on to Americas apron strings as con espouses ...I also feel Con has subscribed to the slightly simplistic imagery of ‘surrendering' to terrorists,... we are not going to wake up to a man in a turban with an ak-47 in our face as Con is eluding to..... i have never said once we should surrender....i feel we need a different approach...therefore i believe that the current war on terror cannot be won....we need a new effort....  \\n  \\r\\nSecondly...con seems to be slightly obsessed with me not answering his questions....i will be happy to...let's start with his ideas about Britain ‘winning' the war with the IRA.... agreed to an extant but again i think his knowledge is clouded somewhat.,....while the main core of the IRA have given up operations is he aware that only in the last 2-3 months there have been new terrorists incidents by spin of groups carrying on their struggle..Groups such as the ‘The Real IRA' are still active and many in Northern Ireland and Ireland have nothing but hatred for us Brits....so the IRA marches on....  \\n  \\r\\nThe fact that i said in my last argument that the war on terror was a war against ‘Muslim extremism' does not mean i am playing games with the definition as Con is trying to convey.... i am simply pointing out what we already know....we no they are terrorists and we know they are largely if not all Muslim....and thats about it....i have not magically whisked up a definition.,...i am simply saying what we all ready know....  \\n  \\r\\nCon has totally missed the point concerning my last point about what the British Foreign Secretary said about the phrase ‘war on terror'....i will briefly remind readers that the foreign secretary said..  \\r\\nUltimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken\" and later said \"Historians will judge whether [the notion] has done more harm than good\".  \\n  \\r\\nThe British foreign secretary talks about how the use of the phrase ‘war on terror' was wrong but more importantly says in the article that we cannot fight a war with this ‘tag line' because its far to vague and we draw dangerous ‘dividing lines' as to who is a terrorist and who isn't ....thats how we get incidents like Guantanamo Bay occurring and we mistreat innocent people and draw them away from being sympathetic to the west... i quote the foreign secretary further....  \\n  \\r\\n\"The more we lump terrorist groups together and draw the battle lines as a simple binary struggle between moderates and extremists or good and evil, the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common,\" Miliband argues, in a clear reference to the signature rhetoric of the Bush era. \"We should expose their claim to a compelling and overarching explanation and narrative as the lie that it is.\"  \\r\\nCon tried to bizarrely rearrange the foreign secretaries argument to fit in to his ideas and beliefs concerning this debate... Cons words in full were...  \\n  \\r\\n‘What the Secretary is espousing is that the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism should be police rules with search warrants, lawyers, and forensic evidence gather on battlefields and presented in trials. ‘  \\n  \\r\\nIf anybody would like to read the full article here is the link...as you will see it has nothing to do with what Con is talking about.,...   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  \\n  \\r\\nThe fact is readers is that if we fight this war in the name of ‘the war on terror' we are playing a dangerous game... The term is so loose.....as the article by the foreign secretary explains a state like America cannot ‘kill its way' out of trouble...what Con is suggesting is that America can simply blow away these invisible terrorists in a hail of bullets and bombs....does he realise that in the process America and its allies are killing innocent civilians who are misconceived as terrorists?..further alienating the world from Americas self imposed ‘crusade'........the more America continues to pursue an enemy is can neither find or destroy the more it will alienate the world from its cause and therefore will loose or find itself in a stalemate with its ‘war on terror'  \\n  \\r\\nCon once again wants to go back to this Cold War argument...he mentioned that the point was not ‘to remove an ideaology but to remove it as a significant threat'....well surely he cannot tell me that Russia is no longer a threat?....although Russia presents itself as a democracy or ‘democratic' it still has undertones of its communist past....Russia is rapidly rearming....the present regime is cutting down on press freedoms and it has recently invaded the small state of Georgia....Its Communists attributes are still there....this shows clearly that Americas economic victory was not enough to silence the Russian monster for long....an ideology grows the seeds of discontent which leads to rearming....and ideology leads to terrorism.... for Con to somehow say that an ideology is not important is nonsense....an ideology is the root that grows the problem in the first place....  \\n  \\r\\nCon talks about this new ‘war on terror' is also about stopping states producing and selling nuclear weapons to terrorist or using the weapons themselves against the west....i feel this is a half truth....i refuse to believe for a second that before 9/11 America was somehow not trying to stop nuclear weapons falling in to the hands of terrorists....its simply a continuation of a long American foreign policy...but unfortunately now comes under the meaningless banner of ‘the war on terror'....its not some new phenomenon.  \\n  \\r\\nFinally Con's ideas in regards to stopping small invisible clandestine terrorist's cells is not convincing....he claims the following....  \\n  \\r\\n‘ Pro asks what stops anyone from setting up a terrorist cell. There are several things. One is that there is limited supply of nutcases to recruit, and as civilization intrudes into the feudal strongholds of the world the supply will be diminished.'  \\n  \\r\\nCons point is simplistic....is he telling me that the men who bombed the London underground came from ‘feudal strongholds'? No...they were born, educated, lived and worked in England....yet they carried out a devastating attack....the whole point why this type of terrorism is unique is that it draws men and women from all warps of life and from all over the world...it is not just from feudal strongholds with little bearded men waving a Koran which is what Con believes.....  \\n  \\r\\nCons failure to understand the conflict is almost a metaphor of American foreign policy itself....America cannot defeat an ideology...America cannot chase an invisible enemy and invisible cells...Con offers no original argument to combat this.... I have shown this in all my arguments presented in both rounds...yet Con is trying to wean the debate to a more patriotic slant.  \\n  \\r\\nThe motion stands.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nI believe that American involvement in any Middle East Peace deal is more harmful than helpful. As we all know the majority of Arabic leaders in the Middle East want nothing to do with America. Most Arab leaders already have feelings against Israel and adding America to the mix only makes things worse. It seems to me that Israeli's need no assistance in taking care of the situation themselves. The financing and brains for the response comes from their own people. Americans have no experience in dealing with the kind of situation Israel has been in for the last 60 years of its existance. We are not under constant stress of suicide bombings and other miscellaneous acts of terror at regular intervals. We live in relative calm over here in the United States so how can we explain to Israel how to coordinate a peace effort. They are doing the only thing they can do - defending themselves. Look at our mess in Iraq. What peace did we create? We have caused more problems then anything there. Destroyed their military - sent all military home (talk about job loss - what do you think that did for their economy/ job rate), dismantled their sanitary systems... the place is in chaos. Then we want to go to Israel and tell them how to have peace. What a joke.  \\r\\nThen you have US media trying to have a pity party for the Arabs whenever Israel does respond to a current attack! Oh, those poor woman and children who were in the area when Israel attacked. Look at all the killing of innocent civilians Israel does - Stop them! Why don't we ever hear about the thousands of men, woman and children that have died in Israel at the hands of terrorists. The monthly, weekly, and sometimes daily attacks that they have to live through. And that is the key, you have to 'live' through it. We don't step out our door everyday and wonder if it is going to be our last. How could I presume to tell anyone in Israel how to handle a situation like that?</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nThank you for your response – I will now reply to your claims.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that America has a place in the world to ensure that people throughout the world are treated with dignity. We fought Hitler for this reason. We ‘saved' the Kurds.  \\n  \\r\\nAmerica has, from 1492 until this present day, planned genocide for the Native American peoples on our own land. To get their land, oil, gold, forests, and whatever else our government coveted from these mistreated citizens. It is a known fact that our government purposely donated blankets and clothing infested with small pox to kill off Natives in many areas. An early case of biological genocide. America has from the arrival of the first boatload of African (American) slaves never learned how to treat our black brothers equally and with dignity. I am with Teddy Rollek, long time mayor of Jerusalem, who said – \"When you learn how to get along side by side with your black citizens, then come and teach us how to get along side by side with Palestinians.\" (Not an exact quote.)  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that no group or person needs to be subjected to terrorism. We are there to help.  \\n  \\r\\nThe problem with American policies in the Middle East is that they follow a course of ‘selective' rescue. (As did the policies of the French and British before them.) If America was truly a defender of innocent people from terrorism, where were they when Israeli villages were being totally wiped out by Arabs from their very inception until now? This is not a recent problem. The U.S. is not an altruistic defender; it is a ‘selective' defender. That helps only when they gain. America set up Saddam in Iraq. He didn't follow their program. Now he's a terrorist. Same thing in Vietnam, same thing in Korea, same thing in Cuba, same thing in India and the same thing in several small countries of Africa. The whole world sees it. The Middle East doesn't need us. It resents our intrusion. We don't know who to treat our own citizens, let alone theirs. There will be less bloodshed if America stays out.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that America needs to ‘spread the security around' – expand our military around the globe for security of all.  \\n  \\r\\nIf indeed the American government did protect others out of high moral standards – the whole world would cheer. This is not, in fact, what is happening. The whole world hates and criticizes Americans. Since Bush's two terms, it is not safe for Americans to travel abroad in many areas of the world. This is because the world sees we are in other countries for our own gain. To rip off oil or other benefits – not to help defenseless citizens. Our real motives are being exposed everyday. We don't belong in the Middle East. Many anti-American statements (unfortunately) have a legitimate basis. Due to our government policies – many, many times our troops have been angels of destruction, not angels of redemption.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that the present chaos in Iraq is why we cannot leave now.  \\n  \\r\\nAmericans are raised with very ethnocentric ideals. That is – we think our way is best and best for everyone. It is not. The first main goal of Iraqi Freedom is flawed. Democracy, as we know it, is not the most workable, best-case scenario in all parts of the world. Americans need to live with the fact that other forms of government may work better in certain situations. I'm not condoning malicious despotism, but you can't suddenly change a whole culture, government and mind-set of a nation just because you think they need your form of government. You can adjust, alter, and advise for improvement. This is centuries old practice being tossed out as no-good. They may not want something new. They may not need it. We tell Middle Eastern countries they need women's rights. There is hardly a country there that has not had at least one-woman head of state. American has never had it. What about that? Are they behind, or are we?  \\n  \\r\\nAs for protecting the new government from insurgents – this would not be necessary if Americans were not trying to foist their own system onto an unwilling recipient. The so-called insurgents are ordinary people like Paul Revere, Nathan Hale, and Benjamin Franklin who don't like a colonialist, imperialistic, big bully nation telling them what to do, and they will fight at whatever cost to free themselves from it.  \\n  \\r\\nWe totally destroyed Iraq while playing with and experimenting with new weapons. Iraq was a test-field for our new military inventions. On that you are correct. We need to rebuild the whole country for free – no strings attached. Then leave.  \\n  \\r\\nAwaiting your response.</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\n  \\r\\nThank you again for your response. I also am enjoying the debate…  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that since 1865 no one has been subjected to slavery and that Native Americans today are not subject to losing their lands.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Civil War ended the legal use of slavery. One law, one piece of paper signed by a president, could not change the mind set and behavior of an entire nation, or section of a nation, instantaneously. The Reconstruction years after The Civil War and all the way up to the present (cases such as Rodney King) are filled with instances of not only discrimination, but hangings and other severe abuse. If this were not the case, there would have been no need, in the 60's, for a March to Washington or for leaders such as King, Malcolm X etc., to defend their black brothers.  \\n  \\r\\nAs for Native Americans, there is legislation at this very moment, in Washington D.C., to deprive Natives of more land, to shrink their reservations, to take away the beautiful forests (that Natives are so careful to preserve) and chop them down. The government covets these resources. Income from casinos in't, in every case, the answer to the economic plight of Natives. It is tantamount to a black man from Harlem winning the lottery. Neither has been trained how to use the money wisely. Both Natives and Black Americans had their cultures ripped away from them by the white majority. They previously had very decent, very dignified, very disciplined cultures. The U.S. government now wants to solve a few centuries of deprivation and disaster by handing them a few bucks by way of Casino rights or ghetto housing projects. It doesn't quite do the trick.  \\n  \\r\\nAs individuals, you (and many others) hope for the day when everyone is treated equally, fairly and with dignity. We hope our country can lead the way showing other countries as well. Children copy their parent's behavior. If parents set a bad example, the children learn the wrong behavior. If America treats its own citizens poorly – how can we expect to train others?  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that America sends millions, possibly billions to the Israeli military and that we do indeed intervene, if without actual military presence (which might be against public opinion). Let me restate the issue. My promise is not that we do not help at all or that we need a military presence to actually be of help. My main criticism is that our help or aid, almost always has strings attached. Whether Israel or anywhere else we ‘use' aid or defense as a lever to gain what we want; sometimes without the request or approval of the recipient country. We step in to ‘help' for reasons of our own and with our own hidden agenda. This is what causes the friction. Additionally, in the middle of a dispute or conflict, our American government may switch sides and cause even more upheaval, if they find it to their advantage. ‘True help' has no strings attached and can actually be beneficial to both sides in a conflict. We shouldn't hate Natives, African Americans or Arabs. We should, as you suggest, promote peace among all people. (You may be surprised to know that there are areas in Iraq/Iran where Jews are being treated better than many Western nations have treated them.) It has been a blight on the reputation of the West that they are known for entering a region and pitting one group against another for their own purposes. They did it in the French and Indian War, with Native American tribes, in India with Hindus and Muslims, in the Middle East with Jews and Arabs. Is it any wonder foreign nations are leery of Western ‘help'?  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that terrorists will overrun Iraq and create a haven for terrorists if U.S. troops leave. Every nation has true terrorists, misfits and radicals. Iraq may have more than its share. Does that justify the whole U.S. Army taking possession of the country and blowing most of it to pieces along with hundreds of civilians and millions of dollars worth of property and businesses? Saddam himself did not wreak this kind of damage on his country. Something is dreadfully wrong here. Again – if we had a motive of helping against terrorists we could have volunteered a small task force of special agents to help. The whole country is not terrorists. I still maintain that most of those labeled ‘insurgents' are simply those rejecting the American presence.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that to leave Iraq now would mean that those soldiers who have died there have died in vain. What did they die for? Do they know? And is that why army suicides are at an all-time high? Because they, more than anyone, know we don't belong there? Do not interpret my comments to mean I am anti-American or Anti-Government. I love my country, my Americans in uniform – but our own government is leading us down the wrong path.  \\n  \\r\\nPlease respond.  \\n  \\r\\nGod Bless America with Change!</td>\n",

       "2261   \\n  \\n  \\n  Thanks Con.        Opening Argument:  C1) Building Collapse      I'll begin by directly addressing the three towers at the WTC   that were brought down, specifically the two main towers that had two   separate passenger airliners enter each of them; with the   American Airlines Flight 11   flying into the North Tower and   United Airlines Flight 175   flying into the South, and the third Tower [Tower 7] simply coming down on its own   without   any plane crashing into it or any external components. It should come as no surprise that all three towers that came down at the World Trade center were considerably well-made , these buildings were specifically made to withstand pressure--and the event of a plane[s] crashing into them, given their height which stood at 1,368 and 1,368 feet--making them the world's largest buildings. For two such buildings to suddenly come down at a free-fall speed in fact defies basic physics and never has anything remotely similar happened before or after 9/11.   \\n  \\n  The only explanation for the fall of all three towers is controlled demolition, something that can even easily be seen in captured footage--and in comparisons made to other examples of controlled demolitions. Both the North and South Tower showed no sign of falling down   and instead were withstanding the steady flames inside; before suddenly as the one hour mark was approaching, the North Tower dramatically collapsed after being followed by the South. The point of the Tower 7 should again be highlighted, as this was the tower that absolutely   no   plane enter it and would've easily been able to withstand any outside pressures.     C2) Thermite Explosives and Witness Testimony   Another striking piece of evidence is traces of Nano-thermite found in dust samples and molten metal that was found from all three towers—the only reasonable explanation for this is once again, a controlled demolition in which explosives were planted in the Twin towers. North and South collapse from the top which suggests explosives were placed in the top floors of the buildings, while Tower 7 collapses at ground level; meaning that explosives were placed at the very bottom. Witnesses and survivors of 9/11 have all stated that they heard numerous explosions coming from within the buildings, directly before they fell at free-fall speed; which was well under 10 seconds.         Again, why exactly would all three buildings have traces of Nano-thermite in them and why would there be explosions? On the basis of two planes crashing into the towers, they would not occur.   C3) Removal of Evidence   \\n  \\n  Instead of examining it and inquiring as to why three supremely well-structured buildings completely collapsed at free-fall speed, the evidence was promptly removed and not examined. The structural steel from the tower was specifically the most important piece of evidence—as it could’ve shown exactly why the buildings collapsed which they should not have. Additional evidence that has been destroyed are tapes that were recorded by     around six air traffic controllers who handledhijackings on 9/11/01. This doesn’t stop at the WTC either, after the Pentagon crash officials began immediately to remove all evidence. Naturally this wouldn't’t be an issue if any evidence was presented of the entire 9/11 attacks   but it never was. This lack of transparency from the U.S government led to many experts calling for a proper investigation to the 9/11, particularly at the WTC.   C4) Pentagon Crash  \\n  \\n  One of the major errors here is how exactly a 38 metre and 13,5 metres high passenger plane could only leave a hole that is 5 metres wide; obviously this is implausible. In addition, every passenger plane crash in history has left debris including large parts of the plane itself, where as no real debris was found at the exact place the plane went   into. Given that the plane was supposed to be a Boeing 757, it also would’ve entirely smashed the surrounding windows. There is no way that the wings of such a plane could not demolish them. Another fact is that there were 86 cameras all around the Pentagon building, yet only one camera was used to display footage of the plane and this shows invariably nothing; neither the plane entering the building. Being a passenger plane, the Boeing 757 was also not made to go fast at such a low level [I.E ground] or make quick manoeuvres in the air.        \\n  \\n  The Pentagon airspace is in fact the most protected airspace in the world, so how is that a jet was able to enter it without any deterrence? Any unidentified planes would be observed and dealt with immediately  .   C5) False Terrorist Link     Perhaps one of the most important aspects to the 9/11 Hoax is the terrorist link. The official U.S government version is that a total of 19 Arab terrorists managed to attack three separate buildings, the North and South Towers in New York, and the Pentagon--apparently all at the command of Osama Bin Laden who was accused as the main suspect by the U.S. The first issue in this is the fact that he never made the U.S most wanted list specifically for being responsible for 9/11. Osama never officially confessed to orchestrating the attacks and instead strongly denied all responsibility in 2001, stating that as Muslim he is   \"strictly forbidden\"   to   \"cause harm to innocent women and children\".    Videos released by the U.S clearly show that the men within them are   not   Osama, due to the differences in physical appearances   and   apparently age.      Moving to the other 19 accused terrorists, it should be highlighted that many  of them are in fact   alive  . These include   Abdul Aziz Al-Omari, he was quoted in 2001 as saying to British Newspaper the Telegraph:     “I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list. They gave my name and my  date of birth, but I am not a suicide bomber. I am here. I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane. I had nothing to do with this.”  This presents the question of how exactly can a man can fly a plane into the World Trade Center, miraculously survive, escape authorities, and then somehow make it back to Saudi Arabia a few days later?   Another was Saeed Al-Ghamdi, accused of being aboard flight, who also reported to the Telegraph  in 2001:      “  I was completely shocked. For the past 10 months I have been based in Tunis  with 22 other pilots learning to fly an Airbus 320. The FBI provided no evidence of my presumed involvement in the attacks.”  So rather than flying a plane into the WTC this man was also in the Middle East at the exact  time 9/11 took place. Now onto Waleed Al-Shehri, the Daily Trust reported in 2001 that:      “His [Al-Shehri] photograph was released by the FBI, and has been shown in newspapers and on television around the world. That same Mr Al-Shehri has turned up in Morocco, proving clearly that he was not a member of the suicide attack.”         Note that the U.S still categorized them as culprits and continued with their \"suicide bomber\" status even  after these statements were released and they were found to be alive in the Middle East.   Another so-called suicide bomber of the plane that crashed into Pennsylvania, Ahmed Al-Nami, also stated in 2001 in his defence:      \"I’m still alive, as you can see. I was shocked to see my name mentioned by the American Justice Department. I had never even heard of Pennsylvania where the plane I was supposed to have hijacked.”   The BBC additionally reported in 2001:      “Another of the men named by the FBI as a hijacker n the suicide attacks on Washington and New York has turned up alive and well.”   As well as the CNN reporting on another hijacker:  “Adnan Bukhari is still in Florida”      C6) Zionist Connection   \\n  \\n  The private property developer and former   chairman of the Jewish Appeal, Larry Silverstein, signed a lease on the WTC two months prior before the   attacks. His initial move upon buying the WTC complex was change the security  company to   Securacom, a company that George Bush’s brother happened to be the board of directors of. As well as the change in the security, Silverstein also increased the insurance policies of the complex; meaning that he was awarded a full $7,2 billion compensation after the 9/11 attacks. The fact is that the buildings were no longer financially profitable [mainly due to asbestos] and Silverstein and company actually stood a lot to gain—as well as Israel, who Silverstein regularly donates significant amounts of money to.  It also seems that Israeli’s within New York were forwarded of the attack, on September 12  th   2001 the Jerusalem Post reported:        “  The Israeli foreign ministry has collected the names of 4,000 Israelis believed to have been in the areas of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon at the time of the attack.\"     \\n   However, only one Israeli at the WTC was killed on that day; indicating that the 4,000 number is a rather large amount to have survived without any severe injury. Other pieces of evidence include Israel trying to suppress a classified report on 9/11 and the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak somehow knowing in an interview with the BBC that Osama Bin Laden was responsible for the attacks, despite the fact they’d only just happened and that no one had been formally identified.      \\n  The Zionist Connection to 9/11 connects easily to what *motives* existed. As well as financial gain for one of U.S’s most powerful Jews. There's also the War on Terror that would come soon after the attacks. Having such attacks on the U.S and a large loss of life gave the U.S   government the perfect excuse to invade the Middle East on the premise that the U.S was literally under attack by militant Islam and that peoples lives would be in danger if they did not “confront” it directly—by invading Iraq and Afghanistan.    The U.S went into Iraq with the primary aim of overthrowing, Saddam Hussein, someone who on the contrary to inciting   error actually managed to control extremist fractions within his country. Israel in particular had a lot to gain, and repeatedly advised the U.S to invade.   Sources:        http://pasted.co...        \\n   \n",

credibility.\"   Most Muslims are not suicide bombers, yet the bombers had a negative effect on the creditability of that religion as a whole. If you cant see that unlawful killing of doctors is not going to harm your cause then you need to wake up and look around.      \"you havent answered... do we use politics and law if people were out killing two year olds generally legally but sometimes illegally?\"    People aren't killing 2 year old legally. For your question to have any bearing the 2 year old would have to have much more in common with a fetus then your question lets on. We need apples to apples not apples to oranges. To answer your question i would have to be able to put myself in a world where a 2 year old was totally reliant on the mother only, this reliance could not be passed off to someone else, where at times the 2 year old could present a serious risk to the mother’s life. I can’t imagine such a world. So I can’t answer your question.      \"i showed witess[sic] testimony from his own workers and how he changed the measurements to determine viability... that means he did it illegally. what more do we need?\"    A court conviction. What you have put forth one can say is unethical. You need a court of law to actually say he broke the law.    \"it migght[sic] not have wroked in corut[sic] but who cares?\"    Anyone who care about the creditability of the pro-life movement should care. Plus it means he was not found guilty.      \"1 saved is enough\"   The person who shot Dr. Tiller broke the law. Had i been at that church with a gun should i have prevented that murder? One life saved is enough. The murderer was a bad person in attempting to kill and succeeding in killing Dr. Tiller. Honestly those that support the murder of doctors who perform abortions because they are \"bad people\" are no different than those who support suicide bombers because their victims are also \"Bad people\".      Dr. Tiller was in one court battle. He was acquitted. [1] I ask 2 things of Pro, please stop saying what he was doing was illegal and please capitalize his name like you have of other people in your posts. If Pro continues to misrepresent Tiller’s actions as illegal and selectively not capitalizing his name I do ask that you grant conduct points in my favor.      \"(the prolife clinic next to his had a 90% success rate.\"    Success rate of what exactly? And what happened to the other 10%?      \"he was in it for money, pure and simple.\"    Irrelevant.      \"im not against fixing social problems that cause abortions. but that dont mean we cant kill tiller etc too.   remember im not advocating all doctors just tiller, maybe carhart, and a select few.\"   I am sure the Muslim terrorist aren’t advocating killing all the westerners just the ones that disagree with them.      There is one thing I wish to thank Pro for I have decided to start donation to Planned Parenthood as a small way that I can combat the terrorist in the prolife movement.      If one looks at my profile they will see I am an atheist, but on behalf of Christians everywhere I ask Pro to change her view or change her status because when you think about killing doctors the answer to WWJD is not \"go grab my glock\".      I find Pro’s views to be deplorable and besides donating to Planned Parenthood I am going to now stop and talk with the protesters and counter protest.      if convincing me and others like me to be actively in opposition with the prolife movement is not a clear example of why killing Dr. Tiller is not good for the pro -life movement then I concede.  \\n  [1]  http://www.nytimes.com...   \n",

negativity applied to muslims... but as a wahole ppls better sense is they arent nearly all bad\"  \\r\\nSo much of Pro's final post is unreadable. Best I can tell Pro agree suiside bombers have hurt the world's view of Muslims. Pro fails to ague that my comparison between Muslim terrorist hurting the Muslim cause and pro-life terrorist hurting the pro-life cause is invalid.

Naziism was the twin of Islam ideologically.  \\n  \\r\\nIn 1941, Haj Amin al-Husseini came to Germany and met with Adolf Hitler, Von Ribbentrop, Heinrich Himmler, Joachim and many other Nazi leaders.

Gaza Strip, Sheikh Muhammad Sallah “Abu Rajab” brandished a knife, calling upon his brothers in the West Bank: “Stab!” “Oh young men of the West Bank: Attack in threes and fours,” he said, and “cut them into body parts.”  \\n  Following are excerpts:  \\n  Muhammad Salah “Abu Rajab”: Brothers, we must constantly remind the world, and everyone who has forgotten… The world must hear, via these cameras and via the Internet: This is Gaza! This is the place of trenches and guns! This is the West Bank! This is the place of bombs and daggers! This is Jerusalem… Jerusalem is the code word… This is Jerusalem… Much can be told about Jerusalem. This is where the soldiers of the Prophet Muhammad are. This is the grace of Allah. The soldiers of the Prophet Muhammad are here. Brothers, this is why we recall today what Allah did to the Jews. We recall what He did to them in Khaybar.  \\n  Today, we realize why the Jews build walls. They do not do this to stop missiles, but to prevent the slitting of their throats.  \\n  “Abu Rajab” brandishes a dagger and makes stabbing motions  \\n  My brother in the West Bank: Stab! My brother is the West Bank: Stab the myths of the Talmud in their minds! My brother in the West Bank: Stab the myths about the temple in their hearts!  \\n  Today, we have declared a curfew in Israel. Listen to what the Jews are saying to one another: Stay at home, or go outside to your death. They have no alternative. Oh men of the West Bank, the first phase of the operation requires stabbing in order to bring about a curfew.  \\n  -----  \\n  Here is Hitler in an anti Jew speech. Islam is the great \"Nazi-like\" group with a negative fixation on the Jews.  \\n  http://youtu.be...  \\n  -----  \\n  Here is an anti-Jew sermon given by an Egyptian Muslim cleric.  \\n  http://youtu.be...  \\n  -----  \\n  In Nazi Germany it was illegal to be homosexual. Hitler saw it as a sign of weakness and would not stand for it within his country. He saw homosexual men as feminine and weak, unable to fight for the cause, unworthy of life.  \\n  Once the Nazis took power in 1933, they intensified persecution of homosexuals. The persecution ranged from the dissolution of homosexual organizations to internment in concentration camps.   \\n  https://www.ushmm.org...  \\n  -----  \\n  Islam goes well beyond merely disapproving of homosexuality. The Sharia teaches that homosexuality is an evil form of fornication, punishable by death.  \\n  Abu Dawud (4448) - \"If a man is seized committing sodomy, he will be stoned to death.\"  \\n  Al-Tirmidhi, Sunan 1:152 - Muhammad said \"Whoever is found conducting himself in the manner of the people of Lot, kill the doer and the receiver.  \\n  --  \\n  (Muslim Countries where homosexuality may be punished by death)  \\n  https://www.washingtonpost.com...   \n",

points without making it seem that I am conceeding anything?  \\n  \\r\\nI fear I cannot.  \\n  \\r\\nHowever his arguments DO infact have some gaping holes. I can acknowledge that not all Syrians are Muslim. But with a crappy vetting process, or no vetting process at all, how do we know this for sure? More specifically, how do we know that the refugees coming into America are not Muslim? If we are to say, \"they are Muslim, so what?\" then how do we know they are not radicalized? WE DON'T. nd since Glorious Leader Obama refuses to vet these combat aged men (where are the widows and children he has spoken about? The vast majority are combat aged men)[1], it's better to be safe than sorry.  \\n  \\r\\nLet me ask my opponent a personal question. Going through your profile, I could not gauge whether you were, Jewish, Christian, Atheist etc. I could not gauge whether you were straight or gay. Let's assume then. Let's assume you are either Jewish, Christian or Atheist. Here is the question I would like to ask:  \\n  \\r\\n1. Do you enjoy your Judaism, Christianity, or Atheism?  \\n  \\r\\nIf you answer yes, then under Sharia Law you would be in danger if you did not convert to Islam.  \\n  \\r\\nHow does this tie in to the refugees? Simple. We simply do not know what these people want. Do they have an agenda? Possibly. When you look at the Koran, you see that it is VERY evident that it calls for the Islamification of the whole world. And by violent means if necessary. If these refugees were all Christian, there would be no argument, but we cannot take any chances. Not in a post 9/11 world  \\n  \\r\\nI would like to point out the story of Ronnie Smith. I knew Ronnie. He was a deacon in my church. I did not know him well, but I have talked to him on a few occasions. About two years ago, he and his wife and son were living in Lybia as he taught I belive it was physics. One day he was out for his morning run when he was gunned down. We don't know if these attackers were radicalized or what. Is that a risk we want to take on our own soil?[2]  \\n  \\r\\nAlso, regarding Sharia Law, my opponent does not seem to know what this entails. I'll let radical Muslim cleric, Adjem Choundry speak for me in this link[3]  \\n  \\r\\nFinally, Must we forget about Paris and my home town of San Bernardino? [4][5] At least in the case of the San Bernardino tragedy, we know the shooters were radicalized before coming to America.  \\n  \\r\\nI ask again, is this a something we want to risk with the refugees, with no vetting process?  \\n  \\r\\n1.   http://www.allenbwest.com...  \\r\\n2.   http://edition.cnn.com...  \\r\\n3.   http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org...  \\r\\n4.   https://en.wikipedia.org...  \\r\\n5.   http://www.latimes.com...  \\n  \\r\\nI apologize for any spelling errors, my keybord is horribly messed up   \n",

I never got the email notification.  \\n  \\r\\n1. The 9/11 attackers blended in REALLY well for YEARS before they did what they did. It is asinine to assume that Islamic Syrian Refugees are automatically peaceful just because Supreme Leader Obama says so. This is the same thing that happened in WW2. Nazis came over to infiltrate America and join flight schools. They mastered various accents so no one would know theywere German. We figured out who they were by the way they held their cigarettes. How do we know Syrian refugees are not out to harm us? We don't. Shall we really wait until it is too late?  \\n  \\r\\n2. Christianification and Islamifcation are RADICALLY different. There is absolutely no comoparison. Islamification calls for forcible conversion or death. In rare cases, if murder does not happen to those who do not convert to Islam,they are forced to pay a special tax. Islam calls for rape of women, Islam or not. Isam calls for gays to be jailed or murdered. Christianity does none of this. Even in the scriptures quoted, there is no call to violence  \\n  \\r\\n3. A simple understanding of the teachings of the bible shows that so-called \"Radical Christians\" do not actually represent Christianity. As stated above, Islam is vastly different.  \\n  \\r\\n4. There were four different crusades. about three of them were defensive on the Christians' part[1]  \\n  \\r\\n1. www.allenbwest.com/2015/02/jihad-vs-crusades-facts-pain   \n",

and I agree that hate is a big threat to world peace, we can easily point that out from historical events like the Holocaust. However, the USA doesn't intervene with issues in the Middle East based because they hate the people living there, but, because they think that they are like a world superhero that comes to the rescue whenever they 'think' someone's in trouble... But in reality, they are making the situation more worse! They thought that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but when they actually went into Iraq they found nothing... They continue to aid Israel with billions of dollars to just fuel the hatred between Muslims and Jews because they think they're the good guys, but, it turns out to be the other way round as Israel continue to bombard the Gazan Strip with sophisticated weaponry and then blaming it on HAMAS and their harmless, cheap, unsophisticated rockets. It is the USA that goes through all the trouble to wipe out communism and ending up to create yet another problem: Radical Islam. So here's the question, will they dare go through all the troubles to eradicate these Radical Islamists or will they just end up creating yet an even bigger problem...   \n",

However, as I said \"it is America that is currently fueling the hatred between Palestinians and Israelis,\" so what I actually mean from that is if it wasn't for America, the hatred wouldn't be there in the first place would it... The Muslims and Jews would have lived together without hate like back before 1946. It's like what first started the Second World War, the harsh treaty that the Germans were forced to sign right? So back then it was mainly the harsh treaty that was the threat to World Peace, which fuelled the anger and frustration for the Germans. But now however, the biggest threat to World peace is the U.S. Who are fuelling more anger and frustration towards a BIGGER group of people, this could potentially start World War 3, as, all the terrorist groups have to do is get their hands on a nuke and this would be disaster!   \n",

policy forever, As a nation you were angry, upset, bloodied but also embarrassed that such an attack could happen to the worlds most powerful nation. Americas omnipresent belief in its own invincibility was destroyed and tainted in the rubble of the twin towers.  \\n  \\r\\nLike any nation attacked you wanted to find and destroy those who were responsible...however in doing so you waged a war you could never win. My argument has three main points to back this up. The first is as follows....you cant wage war on an idea or 'ideology'.  \\n  \\r\\nThe phrase 'war on terror' was always far to ambiguous....its waging war on an idea or theme not a clear target. It would be like me saying 'I am going to fight bullying in schools'....the idea is far to open and unclear...what defines bullying?...the same example can be applied to the war on terror....just exactly is 'terror' and how are you going to wage a war on this idea?.....All the famous philosophers and theorists on war always say that clear identifiable aims are vital if victory is to be achieved...Clausewitz and Sun Tzu were clear advocates of this....Clausewitz states in his Book 'On War' that without clear achievable aims one will find themselves in a difficult situation.....Obviously using the example of an 19th century theorist might seem daft....and it is true some of his ideas are dated but I feel some of Clauewitz's ideas are everlasting....and his ideas on clear objectives is one of them.  \\n  \\r\\nI believe that America can never win a war with such a unclear objective.....I feel that America are chasing shadows by basing there whole strategy on a objective that is failed in its very definition.  \\n  \\r\\nMy second point to back up my argument is that with Americas continuing presence in the middle east and most notably Afghanistan and Iraq they will continue to increase hatred and suspicion amongst the people in the region.....no matter how you look at it America cannot shrug of the tag that they are 'occupiers' on foreign land rather than peace keeping troops....peace keepers by definition are there to keep the peace not fight a full blown war which is what currently is happening in both Iraq and Afghanistan....I feel America has totally forgotten the main reason why Al queda and other terrorist organisations waged a 'jihad' on them in the first place...it was all down to the fact that American based itself in Saudi Arabia before the first gulf war which many felt was an insult to Islam....I feel that America can never win if they remain a aggressive force inside these countries......  \\n  \\r\\nFinally I feel that America's idea of installing democracy in a country which for the past 2,000 has been led by a Islamic constitution with Islamic beliefs and traditions is wrong.....Americas brand of democracy is not always what people want....the same pair of shoes wont always fit on the same pair of feet.....Vietnam is the obvious example to back up this point.  \\n  \\r\\nIn conclusion I believe that America will never win the 'War On terror' due to its luke warm objectives, its lack of understanding of the culture and institutions of Islamic countries and its aggressive actions in the middle east.   \n",

I would like to say that in some regard i have been playing devils advocate with some of my original points...but i do believe that America are fighting in many regards an unwinnable war in the middle east.  \\r\\nOk...so Con took great issue with my definition with the concept of what the ‘war of terror' actually is. I do not believe for a moment that the debate is rendered ‘meaningless' as Con suggested due to my lack of definition of what the ‘war on terror' is....unless anyone reading this debate has been living in a box for the last 10 years then i can safely assume that we all know that the ‘war on terror' is the battle against Muslim extremism.  \\r\\nCon definition of the war on Terror was as follows.  \\r\\n‘The well-defined goal of the war on terror is to stop hostile action by terrorists against the United States. A well-defined subordinate goal is to remove safe havens wherein terrorists may devise attacks without fear of preemption.'  \\r\\nI have to say that i do not believe that this definition is rounded at all. If one looks at Cons definition it is still extremely transparent....Yes its true that we are fighting a war against terrorist...the whole of the free world is fighting the same war....Yes its true that we are trying to find their safe havens to prevent future attack.....but what i implore the readers to consider when reading Cons definition of the ‘war on terror' is its vagueness....we don't no who these terrorists are....we don't no where they come from...how they are armed and so on.....so i feel Cons definition barely scrapes the surface of a deep and complex issue.  \\r\\nAs recently as January 2009 the British foreign secretary himself claimed that the idea of a ‘war on terror' was deeply unhelpful and does more harm than good....his exact words were as follows.....  \\r\\n‘Ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken\" and later said \"Historians will judge whether [the notion] has done more harm than good\".  \\r\\nCon then went on to bizarrely compare the ‘war on terror' with the Cold War...i understand to an extent why he did this....Yes the west defeated the East...and yes to an extent the west was fighting Communist ideology...but let's not get bogged down in idealism which is what i feel Con is trying to do...look beyond your patriotic zeal and you will see that the Cold War was won due to economics not ideology....American spending power could not be matched by the Russia and its proxy states....so it folded....the fact that the Communist party is still the second largest in Russia today shows out right that it was not the lure of democracy that encouraged Russia to end the Cold War.....therefore showing you can't defeat an idea.  \\r\\nIt is also wrong to compare ‘ war on terror' to the Cold War from a geopolitical stand point....the fact is....that during the Cold War we knew exactly who we were fighting....we knew where the enemy was (primarily Russia and china and there proxy states)...we had an idea of how many weapons they had and what they wanted to achieve...but more importantly ...there was always room for negotiation...now compare this to the ambiguity of the war on terror....is there anyone here who can truly say they know where the ‘terrorists' are?....do we have exact knowledge of their strength and numbers?....do we know what they are planning to do next?....the answer is no....you cannot defeat an idea or a belief.  \\r\\nCon is ultimately playing a dangerous game by being so loose on his definitions..I believe that by simply calling people ‘terrorists' and being insular in your outlook one creates a dividing line.....we can already see it with American foreign policy...the catch phrase...'your either with us or against us'...is terribly dangerous...it effectively draws a line between America and the east and simplifies a tremendously complex issue. America needs to be clear what its goals are or it can never win its ‘war on terror.  \\r\\nCon asks me at the end of his article what i propose the alternatives are...do we just give up the struggle?.,...well i propose this question to him...how does he propose on fighting a failing war? Does he even know how groups like Al Queda are organized?....let me fill him in briefly...and it will shed light on what an impossible task we have confronting us....  \\r\\nAl queda has a central command structure like any organization ranging from financial departments, training committees even media relation committees....however Al queda is unique in that it has an outer periphery which even its leaders have no real control over...Clandestine cells exist all over the world and are organized in such a way that they work independently from Al quedas central hub....These members do not take orders from anyone...they work in Al quedas name and attack targets which they choose...how can you stop this?....what stopping me right now from setting up my own cell? The answer is nothing,,, Leonard Weinbergs book ‘Global Terrorism' sums it nicely..  \\r\\n‘Although the network of terrorist cells has an established leadership and command structure, direct approval from the top is not necessarily needed to commit an act of terrorism in al Qaeda's name. Militants operating within the al Qaeda structure are divided into small, independently operating cells. These cells may receive orders and financial support from top Qaeda lieutenants or they may raise funds and plan operations on their own'  \\r\\nAlthough i would like to expand on this point i am aware that i have a word limit....but the point here is clear...you can't monitor these terrorist groups...just look at the London Tube bombings...they acted on there own independently from any central Al queda Command....we are literally chasing shadows.  \\r\\nMy final point is as follows....I made the case in my original argument that the longer America stays in Iraq and Afghanistan the longer and more protracted the war will be....I also said that the whole reason behind Al quedas original beef with America was centred on the idea that America had trodden on Muslim soil during the First Gulf war...Con dismissed this as ‘nonsense' and regrettably exposed his lack of knowledge of this conflict....again i don't want to drift on to a long and boring explanation of the origins of the conflict but i would say this....  \\r\\nThe whole premise of Bin Ladens first attacks on America were due to its occupation of Saudi Soil...Saudi Arabia is home to Mecca and Medina the holiest sights in the Muslim world...the Vatican or the Jeruselem of the Christian world....The Saudi government rejected the offer of Bin Ladens Mujuhadin or ‘Holy Warrioirs' to protect them during the First Gulf War and instead chose the Americans without thinking of the idealogical consequences....again i defer to the words of Leonard Weinberg...  \\r\\n‘This decision infuriated Bin Laden. Not only was his offer to provide Holy Warriors rebuffed but, more galling still, the government decided to allow the Kingdom , with its Muslim holy sites at Mecca and Medina, to be used against the Infidel Americans.'  \\r\\nThe American presence in Saudi Arabia and other middle eastern locations is the seed that grew to 9/11...for Con to say that its ‘nonsense' simply shows he does not understand the complexities of the conflict...The longer America stays in Iraq and Afghanistan the worse the conflict will become...i am in no way saying that there are not those who want America to stay...but for as long as America stays the voices of extremism will drown out the moderate voices in the Islamic world..remember it is one of Alquedas original goals to expel all American and western influence from the muslim world....  \\r\\nI am running out of room but very breifly...Con has not defined what the conflict is...his cold war comparison is wrong from a geopolitical perspective...America is chasing shadows...i beleive the motion stands.   \n",

I also urge...no no I demand the reader to recognize that both Spain and England were (and still are) strong allies to America and were active in Iraq and Afghanistan......both were keen subscribers to American foreign policy yet both suffered domestic terrorist incidents...France and Germany are not in Iraq or Afghanistan and they have not suffered from this new terrorism.  \\n  \\r\\nTherefore i don't agree at all with Cons slightly blinded assumption that Europe is hanging on to Americas apron strings as con espouses ...I also feel Con has subscribed to the slightly simplistic imagery of ‘surrendering' to terrorists,... we are not going to wake up to a man in a turban with an ak-47 in our face as Con is eluding to..... i have never said once we should surrender....i feel we need a different approach...therefore i believe that the current war on terror cannot be won....we need a new effort....  \\n  \\r\\nSecondly...con seems to be slightly obsessed with me not answering his questions....i will be happy to...let's start with his ideas about Britain ‘winning' the war with the IRA.... agreed to an extant but again i think his knowledge is clouded somewhat.,....while the main core of the IRA have given up operations is he aware that only in the last 2-3 months there have been new terrorists incidents by spin of groups carrying on their struggle..Groups such as the ‘The Real IRA' are still active and many in Northern Ireland and Ireland have nothing but hatred for us Brits....so the IRA marches on....  \\n  \\r\\nThe fact that i said in my last argument that the war on terror was a war against ‘Muslim extremism' does not mean i am playing games with the definition as Con is trying to convey.... i am simply pointing out what we already know....we no they are terrorists and we know they are largely if not all Muslim....and thats about it....i have not magically whisked up a definition.,...i am simply saying what we all ready know....  \\n  \\r\\nCon has totally missed the point concerning my last point about what the British Foreign Secretary said about the phrase ‘war on terror'....i will briefly remind readers that the foreign secretary said..  \\r\\nUltimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken\" and later said \"Historians will judge whether [the notion] has done more harm than good\".  \\n  \\r\\nThe British foreign secretary talks about how the use of the phrase ‘war on terror' was wrong but more importantly says in the article that we cannot fight a war with this ‘tag line' because its far to vague and we draw dangerous ‘dividing lines' as to who is a terrorist and who isn't ....thats how we get incidents like Guantanamo Bay occurring and we mistreat innocent people and draw them away from being sympathetic to the west... i quote the foreign secretary further....  \\n  \\r\\n\"The more we lump terrorist groups together and draw the battle lines as a simple binary struggle between moderates and extremists or good and evil, the more we play into the hands of those seeking to unify groups with little in common,\" Miliband argues, in a clear reference to the signature rhetoric of the Bush era. \"We should expose their claim to a compelling and overarching explanation and narrative as the lie that it is.\"  \\r\\nCon tried to bizarrely rearrange the foreign secretaries argument to fit in to his ideas and beliefs concerning this debate... Cons words in full were...  \\n  \\r\\n‘What the Secretary is espousing is that the rules of engagement in the fight against terrorism should be police rules with search warrants, lawyers, and forensic evidence gather on battlefields and presented in trials. ‘  \\n  \\r\\nIf anybody would like to read the full article here is the link...as you will see it has nothing to do with what Con is talking about.,...   http://www.guardian.co.uk...  \\n  \\r\\nThe fact is readers is that if we fight this war in the name of ‘the war on terror' we are playing a dangerous game... The term is so loose.....as the article by the foreign secretary explains a state like America cannot ‘kill its way' out of trouble...what Con is suggesting is that America can simply blow away these invisible terrorists in a hail of bullets and bombs....does he realise that in the process America and its allies are killing innocent civilians who are misconceived as terrorists?..further alienating the world from Americas self imposed ‘crusade'........the more America continues to pursue an enemy is can neither find or destroy the more it will alienate the world from its cause and therefore will loose or find itself in a stalemate with its ‘war on terror'  \\n  \\r\\nCon once again wants to go back to this Cold War argument...he mentioned that the point was not ‘to remove an ideaology but to remove it as a significant threat'....well surely he cannot tell me that Russia is no longer a threat?....although Russia presents itself as a democracy or ‘democratic' it still has undertones of its communist past....Russia is rapidly rearming....the present regime is cutting down on press freedoms and it has recently invaded the small state of Georgia....Its Communists attributes are still there....this shows clearly that Americas economic victory was not enough to silence the Russian monster for long....an ideology grows the seeds of discontent which leads to rearming....and ideology leads to terrorism.... for Con to somehow say that an ideology is not important is nonsense....an ideology is the root that grows the problem in the first place....  \\n  \\r\\nCon talks about this new ‘war on terror' is also about stopping states producing and selling nuclear weapons to terrorist or using the weapons themselves against the west....i feel this is a half truth....i refuse to believe for a second that before 9/11 America was somehow not trying to stop nuclear weapons falling in to the hands of terrorists....its simply a continuation of a long American foreign policy...but unfortunately now comes under the meaningless banner of ‘the war on terror'....its not some new phenomenon.  \\n  \\r\\nFinally Con's ideas in regards to stopping small invisible clandestine terrorist's cells is not convincing....he claims the following....  \\n  \\r\\n‘ Pro asks what stops anyone from setting up a terrorist cell. There are several things. One is that there is limited supply of nutcases to recruit, and as civilization intrudes into the feudal strongholds of the world the supply will be diminished.'  \\n  \\r\\nCons point is simplistic....is he telling me that the men who bombed the London underground came from ‘feudal strongholds'? No...they were born, educated, lived and worked in England....yet they carried out a devastating attack....the whole point why this type of terrorism is unique is that it draws men and women from all warps of life and from all over the world...it is not just from feudal strongholds with little bearded men waving a Koran which is what Con believes.....  \\n  \\r\\nCons failure to understand the conflict is almost a metaphor of American foreign policy itself....America cannot defeat an ideology...America cannot chase an invisible enemy and invisible cells...Con offers no original argument to combat this.... I have shown this in all my arguments presented in both rounds...yet Con is trying to wean the debate to a more patriotic slant.  \\n  \\r\\nThe motion stands.   \n",

                                 \\n  \\r\\nI believe that American involvement in any Middle East Peace deal is more harmful than helpful. As we all know the majority of Arabic leaders in the Middle East want nothing to do with America. Most Arab leaders already have feelings against Israel and adding America to the mix only makes things worse. It seems to me that Israeli's need no assistance in taking care of the situation themselves. The financing and brains for the response comes from their own people. Americans have no experience in dealing with the kind of situation Israel has been in for the last 60 years of its existance. We are not under constant stress of suicide bombings and other miscellaneous acts of terror at regular intervals. We live in relative calm over here in the United States so how can we explain to Israel how to coordinate a peace effort. They are doing the only thing they can do - defending themselves. Look at our mess in Iraq. What peace did we create? We have caused more problems then anything there. Destroyed their military - sent all military home (talk about job loss - what do you think that did for their economy/ job rate), dismantled their sanitary systems... the place is in chaos. Then we want to go to Israel and tell them how to have peace. What a joke.  \\r\\nThen you have US media trying to have a pity party for the Arabs whenever Israel does respond to a current attack! Oh, those poor woman and children who were in the area when Israel attacked. Look at all the killing of innocent civilians Israel does - Stop them! Why don't we ever hear about the thousands of men, woman and children that have died in Israel at the hands of terrorists. The monthly, weekly, and sometimes daily attacks that they have to live through. And that is the key, you have to 'live' through it. We don't step out our door everyday and wonder if it is going to be our last. How could I presume to tell anyone in Israel how to handle a situation like that?   \n",

                                                                                                                                     \\n  \\r\\nThank you for your response – I will now reply to your claims.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that America has a place in the world to ensure that people throughout the world are treated with dignity. We fought Hitler for this reason. We ‘saved' the Kurds.  \\n  \\r\\nAmerica has, from 1492 until this present day, planned genocide for the Native American peoples on our own land. To get their land, oil, gold, forests, and whatever else our government coveted from these mistreated citizens. It is a known fact that our government purposely donated blankets and clothing infested with small pox to kill off Natives in many areas. An early case of biological genocide. America has from the arrival of the first boatload of African (American) slaves never learned how to treat our black brothers equally and with dignity. I am with Teddy Rollek, long time mayor of Jerusalem, who said – \"When you learn how to get along side by side with your black citizens, then come and teach us how to get along side by side with Palestinians.\" (Not an exact quote.)  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that no group or person needs to be subjected to terrorism. We are there to help.  \\n  \\r\\nThe problem with American policies in the Middle East is that they follow a course of ‘selective' rescue. (As did the policies of the French and British before them.) If America was truly a defender of innocent people from terrorism, where were they when Israeli villages were being totally wiped out by Arabs from their very inception until now? This is not a recent problem. The U.S. is not an altruistic defender; it is a ‘selective' defender. That helps only when they gain. America set up Saddam in Iraq. He didn't follow their program. Now he's a terrorist. Same thing in Vietnam, same thing in Korea, same thing in Cuba, same thing in India and the same thing in several small countries of Africa. The whole world sees it. The Middle East doesn't need us. It resents our intrusion. We don't know who to treat our own citizens, let alone theirs. There will be less bloodshed if America stays out.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that America needs to ‘spread the security around' – expand our military around the globe for security of all.  \\n  \\r\\nIf indeed the American government did protect others out of high moral standards – the whole world would cheer. This is not, in fact, what is happening. The whole world hates and criticizes Americans. Since Bush's two terms, it is not safe for Americans to travel abroad in many areas of the world. This is because the world sees we are in other countries for our own gain. To rip off oil or other benefits – not to help defenseless citizens. Our real motives are being exposed everyday. We don't belong in the Middle East. Many anti-American statements (unfortunately) have a legitimate basis. Due to our government policies – many, many times our troops have been angels of destruction, not angels of redemption.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that the present chaos in Iraq is why we cannot leave now.  \\n  \\r\\nAmericans are raised with very ethnocentric ideals. That is – we think our way is best and best for everyone. It is not. The first main goal of Iraqi Freedom is flawed. Democracy, as we know it, is not the most workable, best-case scenario in all parts of the world. Americans need to live with the fact that other forms of government may work better in certain situations. I'm not condoning malicious despotism, but you can't suddenly change a whole culture, government and mind-set of a nation just because you think they need your form of government. You can adjust, alter, and advise for improvement. This is centuries old practice being tossed out as no-good. They may not want something new. They may not need it. We tell Middle Eastern countries they need women's rights. There is hardly a country there that has not had at least one-woman head of state. American has never had it. What about that? Are they behind, or are we?  \\n  \\r\\nAs for protecting the new government from insurgents – this would not be necessary if Americans were not trying to foist their own system onto an unwilling recipient. The so-called insurgents are ordinary people like Paul Revere, Nathan Hale, and Benjamin Franklin who don't like a colonialist, imperialistic, big bully nation telling them what to do, and they will fight at whatever cost to free themselves from it.  \\n  \\r\\nWe totally destroyed Iraq while playing with and experimenting with new weapons. Iraq was a test-field for our new military inventions. On that you are correct. We need to rebuild the whole country for free – no strings attached. Then leave.  \\n  \\r\\nAwaiting your response.   \n",

                                                                                                  \\n  \\r\\nThank you again for your response. I also am enjoying the debate…  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that since 1865 no one has been subjected to slavery and that Native Americans today are not subject to losing their lands.  \\n  \\r\\nThe Civil War ended the legal use of slavery. One law, one piece of paper signed by a president, could not change the mind set and behavior of an entire nation, or section of a nation, instantaneously. The Reconstruction years after The Civil War and all the way up to the present (cases such as Rodney King) are filled with instances of not only discrimination, but hangings and other severe abuse. If this were not the case, there would have been no need, in the 60's, for a March to Washington or for leaders such as King, Malcolm X etc., to defend their black brothers.  \\n  \\r\\nAs for Native Americans, there is legislation at this very moment, in Washington D.C., to deprive Natives of more land, to shrink their reservations, to take away the beautiful forests (that Natives are so careful to preserve) and chop them down. The government covets these resources. Income from casinos in't, in every case, the answer to the economic plight of Natives. It is tantamount to a black man from Harlem winning the lottery. Neither has been trained how to use the money wisely. Both Natives and Black Americans had their cultures ripped away from them by the white majority. They previously had very decent, very dignified, very disciplined cultures. The U.S. government now wants to solve a few centuries of deprivation and disaster by handing them a few bucks by way of Casino rights or ghetto housing projects. It doesn't quite do the trick.  \\n  \\r\\nAs individuals, you (and many others) hope for the day when everyone is treated equally, fairly and with dignity. We hope our country can lead the way showing other countries as well. Children copy their parent's behavior. If parents set a bad example, the children learn the wrong behavior. If America treats its own citizens poorly – how can we expect to train others?  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that America sends millions, possibly billions to the Israeli military and that we do indeed intervene, if without actual military presence (which might be against public opinion). Let me restate the issue. My promise is not that we do not help at all or that we need a military presence to actually be of help. My main criticism is that our help or aid, almost always has strings attached. Whether Israel or anywhere else we ‘use' aid or defense as a lever to gain what we want; sometimes without the request or approval of the recipient country. We step in to ‘help' for reasons of our own and with our own hidden agenda. This is what causes the friction. Additionally, in the middle of a dispute or conflict, our American government may switch sides and cause even more upheaval, if they find it to their advantage. ‘True help' has no strings attached and can actually be beneficial to both sides in a conflict. We shouldn't hate Natives, African Americans or Arabs. We should, as you suggest, promote peace among all people. (You may be surprised to know that there are areas in Iraq/Iran where Jews are being treated better than many Western nations have treated them.) It has been a blight on the reputation of the West that they are known for entering a region and pitting one group against another for their own purposes. They did it in the French and Indian War, with Native American tribes, in India with Hindus and Muslims, in the Middle East with Jews and Arabs. Is it any wonder foreign nations are leery of Western ‘help'?  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that terrorists will overrun Iraq and create a haven for terrorists if U.S. troops leave. Every nation has true terrorists, misfits and radicals. Iraq may have more than its share. Does that justify the whole U.S. Army taking possession of the country and blowing most of it to pieces along with hundreds of civilians and millions of dollars worth of property and businesses? Saddam himself did not wreak this kind of damage on his country. Something is dreadfully wrong here. Again – if we had a motive of helping against terrorists we could have volunteered a small task force of special agents to help. The whole country is not terrorists. I still maintain that most of those labeled ‘insurgents' are simply those rejecting the American presence.  \\n  \\r\\nYou have stated that to leave Iraq now would mean that those soldiers who have died there have died in vain. What did they die for? Do they know? And is that why army suicides are at an all-time high? Because they, more than anyone, know we don't belong there? Do not interpret my comments to mean I am anti-American or Anti-Government. I love my country, my Americans in uniform – but our own government is leading us down the wrong path.  \\n  \\r\\nPlease respond.  \\n  \\r\\nGod Bless America with Change!   \n",

pentagon apparently all at the command of osama bin laden who was accused as the main suspect by the u s the first issue in this is the fact that he never made the u s most wanted list specifically for being responsible for , having such attacks on the u s and a large loss of life gave the u s government the perfect excuse to invade the middle east on the premise that the u s was literally under attack by militant islam and that peoples lives would be in danger if they did not confront it directly by invading iraq and afghanistan ]   \n",

       "25018  [my second point to back up my argument is that with americas continuing presence in the middle east and most notably afghanistan and iraq they will continue to increase hatred and

definition are there to keep the peace not fight a full blown war which is what currently is happening in both iraq and afghanistan i feel america has totally forgotten the main reason why al queda

moment that the debate is rendered meaningless as con suggested due to my lack of definition of what the war on terror is unless anyone reading this debate has been living in a box for the last years then i can safely assume that we all know that the war on terror is the battle against muslim extremism , my final point is as follows i made the case in my original argument that the longer america stays in iraq and afghanistan the longer and more protracted the war will be i also said that the whole reason behind al quedas original beef with america was centred on the idea that america had trodden on muslim soil during the first gulf war con dismissed this as nonsense and regrettably exposed his lack of knowledge of this conflict again i do not want to drift on to a long and boring explanation of the origins of the conflict but i would say this the whole premise of bin ladens first attacks on america were due to its occupation of saudi soil saudi arabia is home to mecca and medina the holiest sights in the muslim world the vatican or the jeruselem of the christian world the saudi government rejected the offer of bin ladens mujuhadin or holy warrioirs to protect them during the first gulf war and instead chose the americans without thinking of the idealogical consequences again i defer to the words of leonard weinberg this decision infuriated bin laden , the american presence in saudi arabia and other middle eastern locations is the seed that grew to for con to say that its nonsense simply shows he does not understand the complexities of the conflict the longer america stays in iraq and afghanistan the worse the conflict will become i am in no way saying that there are not those who want america to stay but for as long as america stays the voices of extremism will drown out the moderate voices in the islamic world remember it is one of alquedas original goals to expel all american and western influence from the muslim world i am running out of room but very breifly con has not defined what the conflict is his cold war comparison is wrong from a geopolitical perspective america is chasing shadows i beleive the motion stands , the american

assumption that europe is hanging on to americas apron strings as con espouses i also feel con has subscribed to the slightly simplistic imagery of surrendering to terrorists we are not going to wake up to a man in a turban with an ak in our face as con is eluding to i have never said once we should surrender i feel we need a different approach therefore i believe that the current war on terror cannot be won we need a new effort secondly con seems to be slightly obsessed with me not answering his questions i will be happy to let is start with his ideas about britain winning the war with the ira agreed to an extant but again i think his knowledge is clouded somewhat while the main core of the ira have given up operations is he aware that only in the last months there have been new terrorists incidents by spin of groups carrying on their struggle groups such as the the real ira are still active and many in northern ireland and ireland have nothing but hatred for us brits so the ira marches on the fact that i said in my last argument that the war on terror was a war against muslim extremism does not mean i am playing games with the definition as con is trying to convey i am simply pointing out what we already know we no they are terrorists and we know they are largely if not all muslim and thats about it i have not magically whisked up a definition i am simply saying what we all ready know con has totally missed the point concerning my last point about what the british foreign secretary said about the phrase war on terror i will briefly remind readers that the foreign secretary said ultimately the notion is misleading and mistaken and later said historians will judge whether the notion has done more harm than good ]   \n",
