For example, an engineer could have a requirement of working at least 10 years in their own country, doing whatever they like as long as they pay taxes.

I live in this town where there are many people with communist ideas and some of my closest friends have these beliefs. I often find myself arguing with my friends about communism because I have a stiff belief that communism will always lead to a dictatorship or some authoritarian government like it happened in the USSR and still happens in countries like Cuba, Venezuela and China (I didn't refer North Korea on purpose). But my friends say that communism was poorly implemented and their governments were just corrupt, and they say that communism is going to be someday a good regime, unlike the ones in Eastern Europe and so on.

My history teacher, which is very intellectual and reflective, has just thought us that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were right because they shortened the war and prevented a lot of battles and interactions. Even though a lot of people lost their lives during these bombings, a lot more were saved. The bombings prevented a lot of 'potential' losses for both sides.

I'm struggling to see why the bombings were wrong, but I really want to. I kinda feel a bit brain-washed. Please help me change my view!

There's no question that Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld's show about nothing wins out big here. While the one-dimensional twentysomethings on Friends sit around their apartments and make puns at each other all day, Seinfeld's characters navigate bordering-on-outrageous adventures.
Although Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox are somewhat attractive, Seinfeld takes the cake for consistently casting ridiculously good-looking women as the unlikely girlfriends of the self-centered and neurotic leads Jerry, George, and Kramer.

Upholding a personal or religious conviction is not worth risking such big relationship issues. I think couples should have lots of premarital sex experience, and perhaps have a few other partners before settling down.",CMV: It is ludicrous for a couple to save their virginities until they are married.

Therefore, if this is true, absorbing more radiation means kids are more susceptible to brain cancer and other disorders like leukemia or autism.
In speaking about how children shouldn’t be given cell phones, Dr. Lennart Hardell, a professor in oncology and cancer epidemiology at the University Hospital in Orebo, Sweden, stated, “Kids should definitely not be using cell phones, according to our research. We looked into a group who started using these devices before the age of 20 and the study showed a five times greater risk for rare brain cancer.”
Consequently, if cell phone use isn’t limited, it wouldn’t be surprising if the death rate for adults increased in the upcoming decades.","Should children under the age of 16 be allowed to own or to use a cell phone?-- Stance: No, children under the age of 16 shouldn't be given a cell phone."

The former category of posts includes those about laws that make marijuana smoking easier. The justification is that people should be free to choose their favorite method of relaxation, and that weed is no more harmful than cigarettes or alcohol.

The freedom argument isn't applied to cigarettes, and the health argument isn't applied to marijuana.

I believe that downloading music from the internet without paying should not be publically acceptable; After all it is teaching people that it’s ok to ignore laws.
 In addition, it sets up precedent for people to start downloading other forms of media illegally. If people feel like illegally downloading music is ok, are we not in a way telling them that laws are merely a list of suggestions?
And it hurts the producers of the content financially and could potentially put artists out of the job, as people buying music is a major source of income for them. Does downloading music illegally not stop them from making future music?

However most muslims do not think this way.

The symmetry of bunching makes me uncomfortable, I find solace in a neat fold prior to wiping.

If I was ever to bunch, I'd be sure to fold over it. For example: If you're in an airport, obviously the toilet paper is thin, so perhaps I'd bunch instead of folding over 10 times. But I'd ALWAYS fold around the bunch.

But all you pure breed bunchers out there, why do you do it? Do you bunch because you're afraid to feel your anus?

I don't mean people who were ACTUALLY raped, but those who know that that person in no way shape or form ever raped them, but accuse them of doing so.

If that person goes to the police, and lie and claim some dude raped her, knowing he didn't, and somehow that guy gets convicted, there is a part of me that thinks he should break away from the police, and rape her. So that when he goes to jail, he would have actually done the thing he was convicted for.

Pedophilia is considered a mental disease correct?
So is depression.

The entirety of the show is trying to get pedophiles to act on desires. Which would be bad for the child if acted out.

Compare that to depression. What if someone kept messaging you about that you should kill yourself and it will all be ok. And then you try to do it and you get arrested because suicide is illegal.

It's the exact same principle, it's getting people with a mental illness to act on their desires instead of treating them.

Fast food workers receive $7B annually in public assistance, which means that we're all paying for fast food, whether we eat it or not. We wonder why America is fat? Could it be that we're subsidizing labor and profits for companies that profit off selling us crap? I'd say it's not just possible, but it's highly probable.

Companies should have to pay for cost for their employees to live without government assistance. If they won't voluntarily pay their employees a living wage, the government should bill the corporations for the amount of public money paid to each workforce.

Previous research by Bryan Caplan of George Mason University has found that as education increases, beliefs about economics move towards those of economists.

The beliefs of economists are currently the best guess of the truth of economic matters. Therefore, rationality dictates that the opinions of economists should be more valued than non-economists on economic matters.

Furthermore, politicians tend towards the positions of the median voter. Since the median voter will now have opinions closer to those of economists, you will get politicians that have more rational public policy proposals.

This means that incest is a symptom of a larger problem, and if that larger problem were properly rectified then those involved would not want to be a part of the relationship any longer.

That's why, although many rap fans think Kendrick was robbed, I'm glad that Macklemore won the Grammy because I can actually listen to his music without wanting to immediately find the mute button.

Change my view.",I hate most rap/hip-hop music and I don't think it's really music. CMV

I hestitate to call the move criminally stupid only insofar as Portland claims it has such a surplus of clean water that it could easily drain the reservoir on a whim and refill it several times over (without any real environmental impact).

If indeed this is true, and Oregon can easily afford the water for such shenanigans, then surely it's thirsty neighbor would be willing to pay for some of this excess water.

So why do they want to kill themselves? Why the want to waste and squander life? Is it a constant struggle that is pushed down to smile? Is it a scheduled feeling (it's 8pm, time to be sad and want to kill myself)? Is it a feeling that rears in an acute intensity when you're not ready for it, making you just want to stop the pain?

Personally, I feel like it's just people being dramatic. These people I know with it have very fortunate lives, and despite that, continue to feel depressed and occasionally suicidal (or maybe constantly, I'm not telepathic).

To get married as a man means that you will likely have less sex. Your wife will also likely want to have crazy orgasmic and objectively better sex with another man that will never be you.

However, over the years we have (for the most part) accepted that we do not have to fit solely in the most stereotypical roles that gender gives to us. Men can be stay-at-home dads, nurses, or dancers and they are still considered to be 'boys' as women can be the bread-winners, professional athletes, or soldiers and still be considered 'girls.'

To say that they should not be allowed to do otherwise is sexist and I agree, but to me that means that using the term 'gender' for social roles becomes obsolete since someone of either sex can take on non-traditional roles and still be considered part of the gender that traditionally correlates to their sex.

Shouldn't we instead be incentivizing jobs that need more skill and education. I think the best way to incentivize would be to remove or reduce the minimum wage. If someone knows that they can't live based on their pay from a fast-food joint then they'll have even more incentive to get an education and a better job.

A doctor will attend with equipment, and the two may duel. Maybe only to first blood, maybe only until they deem their honor settled. If we're only using thin swords capable of fairly shallow cuts, the risk will be much minimized and the available medical personal should be capable of dealing with any serious wounds that may occur.

My view is that Windows OS and Xbox should be combined. Also that Microsoft should open up the new combined OS to manufactures and let Dell, Toshiba, Gateway, Samsung the ability to produce machines like the XBOX.


I think Android does a great job of this. Google builds the base operating system, and Samsung reworks it with a suite of features. The partnership of companies makes for better products. Ultimately leaving consumers with better devices.


Letting Samsung and HTC build phones using android doesn't stop Google from making the nexus. This partnership also helps Google get their products and services on more then just nexus devices.


This is how I see it working. Microsoft builds Windows OS with XBOX live subscription service or app. The OS can be installed on any machine, but the XBOX live would have system requirements. Windows/Live updates would be downloadable and new systems would come out monthly, without rendering old systems obsolete.","Microsoft should stop making the XBOX franchise, as we know it. CMV"

It humiliates the child and shows the child that it can be ok to humiliate someone. The buttocks where children are usually spanked is an erogenous zone. When spanking is allowed, children are the only people that it's legal to hit, which seems morally wrong or like an unwarranted exception to general morality. It's unnecessary since there are many other ways to discipline children.

A male/female who expects to be treated (or even called) differently when he presents as a woman/man is reinforcing the idea that women and men should be treated differently, and that idea flies in the face of true gender equality.

Essentially, I believe that in a gender-equal society in which ""man"" and ""woman"" labels don't hold any socialized expectations, the feeling that one ""is"" a woman/man despite not being female/male could not have a rational basis.

Basing your preferred gender label on something other than antatomical sex therefore only reinforces gender label stereotypes and is hypocrytical if you also want fewer gender-based assumptions in society.

While I understand the necessity of certain individuals to speak in ebonics for fear of ridicule in their community, the ability to speak properly is necessary if said individuals plan to move up any sort of social ladder. That being said, those individuals who do not intend to move up the social ladder to create better lives for themselves do not deserve any sort of governmental aid. If people do not demonstrate an effort to better themselves, they do not deserve the assistance if the community.

If a person speaks ebonics to me, prejudice immediately presents itself. In ebonics, I see a lack of effort to progress in society, and the acceptance of the lower class status that said person finds him/herself in.

The very ability to speak proper english is absolutely necessary, and those who cannot demonstrate this ability deserve no respect, nor any time out of my day.

Therefore they should not profit from it while allowing those harmed by the business to receive no (or minor) compensation.

The parallels between Putin and past dictators is striking: Putin’s pretext of “protecting” ethnic Russians living in Crimea is almost a duplicate of the Soviet Union’s pretext of helping a “fraternal ally” in its invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.  And Putin decorously asking the Russian legislature for authorization for the use of Russian troops is also instructive:  the legislature, a rubber stamp, gave its unanimous consent.

The parallels to Russia’s takeover of Georgia in 2008 are also evident. 

And if the pretext of “protecting” ethnic Russians is the driving force behind the invasion of Crimea, what’s to stop Putin from taking more of Ukraine – say, the industrially vital central corridor?

I've never been a big fan of school but I just can't see how this can be beneficial. IMO kids need at least some kind of basic skills in terms of literacy and numeracy.

To do otherwise, is extremely shortsighted in my view, because Ukraine is going to have a restive province on their hands with a powerful backer making a military crackdown/ occupation inevitable.  Further down the road we may see something akin to an IRA develop.  This blood will not only be on the hands of Ukrainians but the UN as well since they seek to deny them their democratic voice in the recent referendum.

However, I do have one caveat in this case:  I think that a simple majority would not be sufficient to give Crimea to Russia.  It would have to be a 2/3 supermajority.    ","CMV: I don't see anything ""illegal"" about Crimeans voting to become a part of Russia."

When women wear makeup on date, they are taking advantage of the psychology of male attraction to make themselves have greater mating value.

There is no lifting and no sustained effort required. The person who launches the stone must make an effort to keep the stone moving straight, but this is a fairly simple process. Additionally, estimating the optimal speed at which to release the stone can probably be learned fairly quickly, and retained through latent memory. The player doing the ""sweeping"" must simply gauge the speed of the stone, and whether it is faster or slower than optimal. While I acknowledge that this requires some skill, it is not enough to classify curling as a sport. To me, curling is in the same league as recreational games, such as shuffleboard and minigolf.

I think this is absolutely incorrect.

I believe a candidate's vice presidential pick is extremely important to an election and can greatly impact the final outcome.  If the president can't serve for whatever reason (incapacitation / assassination / impeachment, etc.) this is your president.  I believe that VP candidates should be scrutinized as closely as presidential candidates and it's fair that a VP candidate influences your decision.

I don't think it's logical or responsible to vote for a candidate and essentially disregard their running mate.  The Vice President is a vitally important choice for a political candidate and should affect the outcome of the election.  CMV",A Presidential candidate's choice for VP can and should heavily factor into your voting choice. CMV

Buttons are superior for a variety of reasons including but not limited to: 

* being easily replaceable
* not prone to catching one's genitalia or hair 
* easy use
* durable and not subject to rust
* silent (for war times)
* a zipper can become undone but a button holds in place 
* can be converted into token for poker games or bartering system

Zippers eventually rust/jam/break in time so why not end this inefficient system now? CMV",I believe buttons are superior to zippers and zippers should be abolished. CMV

Second: Patriarchy and ideas of patriarchy are firmly accepted by sociologists and people who study gender theory. Patriarchy is not a term exclusive to bloggers and ""crazy tumblr/srs feminists"", it actually has grounding a broad acceptance among experts.

Third: Though 'gender norms' is a more agreeable title, the fact that certain, particular men are turned off to the name of patriarchy is unfortunate, but I don't think that these are the type of men that are accepting of ideas of privilege and are rather the type of people simply wanting to maintain gender roles and norms, or at least do not want to actively acknowledge their benefit from the system.","Patriarchy is a valid concept grounded in academic literature.

From the standpoint of sociobiology, over the course of human evolution, a man is quite likely to pass on his genes if he abducts a female child and raises her to be an obedient wife. It may offend our modern sensibilities, but the genes that support this highly effective behavior are likely to be prevalent in most men.

My view isn't to be confused with those who use the viral phenmenon to also raise money and accept donations, such as many men do during Movember.

Those who only participate in the viral aspect are doing nothing to actually help. I believe that enough awareness has been raised for cancer that the general public should know that they need to check their breasts, and/or help. I don't think these viral campaigns do anything other than gratify those participating.

Obviously awareness is a good thing, but I think that people are doing it for the wrong reasons result in the purpose of said campaigns being lost, which is to draw peoples attention and donations to problems that exist.

I do believe feminism is responsible for de-mantling some gender roles, and that this helps men. However, can this be proven through a study or some other means? Simply stating that ""gender roles have changed; now men are free from stereotypes"" is not proof in and of itself.  Is there any evidence or are there studies that prove (or imply) that feminism has helped men? I have not found any, and have come to the conclusion that no firm evidence exists. Further, there is evidence (albeit old evidence) of a feminist organization actively discriminating against men. I must conclude, then, that there is only hard evidence of feminism helping women.

Can anyone name one single major achievement the ISS has made?

Furthermore, a significant number of the tests done could have been carried out by unmanned probes.

Of course whether a science experiment can justify its budget is always going to be subjective, so the best way to deal with this is to use relative measures:

At $150bn, the money spent on the ISS could fund the entire University of Cambridge for over a century.

The LHC costs less than a tenth of this and has achieved much more (I know that's subjective- but how many new particles has the ISS discovered?)

You could build and run hundreds, if not thousands of hospitals with the money.

I don't think there should be a reward for smoking as opposed to getting some exercise, socializing with co-workers (without smoking), grabbing a bite to eat, making a personal phone call, meditating, etc. There are a lot of things you can do to make your day better in a 10-15 minute break, and they're pretty much all healthier than smoking a cigarette.

It even makes sense from the employers' standpoint, because happy/healthy workers produce better work - that's why a lot of more forward-thinking employers have gyms, game rooms, etc.

Instead of focusing on arguments which appeal to our inherent sense of logic or morality, everyone becomes focused on how accurate the numbers are.  In my opinion, dissecting statistical studies is a waste of effort, unless maybe the discussion is taking place in an academic setting.  In more casual contexts, such as reddit, I would much rather boil down an issue to its root logical basis and find my argument there.",Statistics are meaningless to me. CMV.

- When talking about choices, it’s the society that gives these choices according to what the majority thinks, hence the more civilized and democratic a society is the more choices people have.

I have to wonder - if ludologists have made such a stupid mistake, what is the point of their job? More importantly, surely they're wasting their time anyway? Their research has been consistently ignored throughout the decades. Very few game designers pay any attention to ludologists, either due to personal choice or due to constraints of following publishers' orders to make another sequel to another bare-bones, simple franchise. Moreover, great games can be made without even knowing about ludology - Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and so on.

So, taking all of this into account, surely ludology is useless?",Ludology is a useless area of research and anyone who calls themselves a ludologist is either delusional or wasting their time. Please CMV.

* In fact, other sports strongly discourage fighting.
* Fights at the major league level heavily influence school level leagues and above (if fighting part of the game, then bans on it are hypocritical in high school or college leagues).

tl;dr Putin's best time for war was until Yanukovich was president, he could invade all country without organazied resistance. But he didnt and instead gave (almost) all country to his enemies, so they can prepare for war.

Everyone knows that 2+2=4. But if I were to believe that 2+2=5, would that change the truth? No matter how much I believe that 2+2=5, that won't change the fact that it equals 4. Truth is not relative and it does not rest on belief. Were this to be the case, then 2+2 could equal anything anyone wanted.
Many times people say, ""Truth is relative."" But what is it relative to? Anything that is relative has to be relative to something that is absolute. Relative can't just stand alone. So, by saying that something is relative, you're really saying that it is relative to something that is absolute.
In other words, your belief can not change the truth. Just as me thinking that 2+2=5 doesn't change the fact 2+2=4, so is truth not changed by whatever you believe.",Absolute Truth-- Stance: There is such thing as absolute truth.

I believe that Nixon should be remembered for his successes, as many other presidents have also been. Without his momentous visit to China in 1972, the vietnam war would not have ended when it did. China would still be ostracized within the international community, and Taiwan would still be gaining the unjustified support it recieved (and still does) today. The cold war may not have ended if not for Nixon, who, in seeking normalised relations with China, put the USSR on the defensive and this can be attributed to its failure.

2. Relationships often have the honeymoon phase, comfortable phase, etc. (I realize I'm not being very scientific here, but romantic love doesn't exactly have many scientific journals on it) This seems very similar to the tolerance that many addicts experience (first experience with a drug seems to be the most intense).

Punishing Russia with sanctions for what is arguably a text book best case scenario for transition of power from one government to another is immoral and goes against basic (US) constitutional principals.

Moreover, if we were to legalize the drugs, we would deal a crippling blow to both domestic and international criminal organizations that rely heavily on the influx of cash from these drug deals (note that just under a half of the wealth of Mexican drug lords comes from marijuana). In the process, the prison system would experience a large-scale relief in the number of inmates jailed for not just offenses relating to drug use, but more importantly violence stemming from illegal sales as the underground market would decay.

Whether it's showing up for an appointment, meeting friends, going out to eat, or going to work, I'll always leave a few minutes late and rush to wherever I'm going.  It's kind of a game to me and makes the commute much more exciting.  I also actually enjoy showing up a few minutes late because I feel better jumping right into things as soon as I arrive.  I don't mind waiting for others, I would just rather come in and be forced to get started immediately.  Also, I don't think it matters at all if someone needs to wait an extra 3 minutes for me.  This has never caused a problem in my life.  Please help me understand why it is so important to arrive early to things?",i am always a few minutes late to everything because i dont see the importance of showing up early. CMV

It looks like they pay you to learn how to become an electrician whereas you have to pay a college $$$ to get a degree and possibly end up in debt for a couple of years.


Furthermore it looks like according to the BLS, that the average wage for electricians and programmers is roughly the same which is at around 70,000 dollars a year.


Then there's the fact that a lot of programming jobs are being outsourced to places like India. Electricians can't get their jobs outsourced.



Finally being an electrician means you get to work outside, you get to stand up longer and it's more physically demanding which means that you'll be more fit, you'll be healthier and you'll live longer.

I, like any average user, doesn't like to keep changing the way things work, especially with software. And since most people use Windows, there is a very high possibility that they are familiar with Word and Outlook, and Windows Live Mail has that similar look and feel to it as Outlook, which makes it easier to use and more appealing.
Personally, I wouldn't mind giving Gmail a shot. But for now, I am quite satisfied with Windows Live Mail.","Yahoo Mail, Live mail or Gmail?-- Stance: Yahoo Mail, Live mai"
