Just this week, I settled a case in mediation for a client.  If the case hadn't settled, there would have be a LOT of trial preparation  over the next two months.  If the case settles early in mediation, the client saves a lot of money.  If the case settles latter in the case, the client doesn't save as much but still saves the expense of completing a trial.

On the other hand, arbitration often requires as much preparation as a jury trial.  In fact arbitration IS a trial, just not in a court of law with a judge and jury.  The client might not save as much or might not save at all. In arbitration, the parties have to pay the arbitrator's fees.",Does the use of ADR mean less money for lawyers?

If they relinquish all legal and equitable interests in the property prior to this eventuality then there is no property to sell.

Assuming your parents are in good health at the moment and this will not happen in the next few years then I cannot see a problem.

Have a talk with a solicitor that specialises in equity and trusts if this is of interest to you.

The other alternative is to sell the property with the clause that they continue to live in it for the rest of their natural lives. There are companies that do this and your parents live there rent free.

Liquor is a little harder to make so somebody could make some money off of it.

It also has to do with the early 1900's when 'black' and 'mexican' people were the majority of people using it, and racism was still 'legal', so they branded marijuana users as murderous 'blacks' and 'mexicans'.

It also has to do with the major corporations political views of it, because hemp is a great resource for clothing and other things, but a big corporation back then was selling another material and didnt want to be put out of business.","Why is marijuana illegal, but liquor IS legal?"

I published one book under a fake name and work as an agent for my grandmother who is just now signed with a publisher and trust me, if i caught someone doing that with my book i wouldnt be happy. Libraries that charge an annual fee have to pay the authories in their library a percentage of profit made from the book if it went out, and no matter what pay taxes.
The only way that it is legal is to charge a late fee, and that is serperate from royalites but even thats taxed. Late fees are slippery slope unto themselves.

No one branch is to have peremptory oversight over the other.  Second of all, judges might easily see things differently.  Some judges think that not Mirandizing a suspect is constitutional while others don't.  You might easily run into a problem where the justices overseeing the President disagree and then you have gridlock - like we need more of those in our government.  Also, just because those overseers say it's constitutional or not doesn't mean the SCOTUS will agree, so they're a moot entity.  Finally, the President has a chief legal counsel who advises him whether or not something is constitutional - don't you remember Alberto Gonzalez claiming that torture was constitutional?  You say that the judges would report the Prez if he executes an unconstitutional action, but who's to say they're right?  It must be left to the SCOTUS.

I don't know if we have ever received an apology from any of the churches that played a role in such atrocities, but I am grateful that the State of Missouri took the Extermination Order off the books in 1976 (sorry folks - it's no longer legal to shoot us on sight). And I'm grateful that the State of Illinois has officially apologized to the Church for what happened there. That's right--in March 2004, a resolution was passed by the Illinois Legislature asking for ""the pardon and forgiveness"" of the Mormon Church for persecution that led to the expulsion of 20,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1844 from Nauvoo, and for the 1844 vigilante murder of Mormon leader Joseph Smith.

The genius of the founding fathers of the United States was not that they knew everything, but that they understood that they could not know everything.

Look at all the amendments which have been added to the Constitution. Every amendment is a slight change to the Constitution to keep it updated with the times.

When the people finally realized that the prohibition of alcohol gave rise to an even greater threat (gangsters like Al Capone), they decided to undo the 18th amendment with the 21st amendment.

Q: Will I lose my job if I take FMLA leave?

Generally, no. It is unlawful for any employer to interfere with or restrain or deny the exercise of any right provided under this law. Employers cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, PROMOTIONS or disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under ""no fault"" attendance policies. Under limited circumstances, an employer may deny reinstatement to work - but not the use of FMLA leave - to certain highly-paid, salaried (""key"") employees.

New Jersey mentions aiding suicide(   2C:11-6.)[3]
Connecticut mentions suicide as a part of definition of murder(e.g "" person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person or causes a suicide by force, duress or deception"")[4]
