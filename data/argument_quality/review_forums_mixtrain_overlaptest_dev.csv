My husband and I eat here every time we visit Vegas.  The service has always been consistently great-call you by name, never a water glass left half full, and servers who know and understand the menu.  The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up!
Emeril-you've done it right again!
We're going to actually try Carnevino, Batali's latest,  on our trip next month for something new, but I know we'll always visit Delmonico's!","Business review: 5.0 Stars

The things that popped out to me was one the sauce made everything dope...the freshness of the fried chicken fingers , and the toast. We don't have this in California so i wanted to jump at the chance to try it. 

It was good i have to admit..this is a spot if you're in a rush to get the funk out of dodge or  need a filler for one of your meals in the day or something to fill up your tummy from a night of galavanting in a city full of alcohol. 

I'm a little disappointed that we don't have this in cali...but Bombskis nonetheless

I'd heard some decent things so was pretty excited about what was to come.  Big disappointment.  The menu is puny so apart from tofu dumplings and a mini tofu salad there were no vegetarian selections, not even actual vegetable selections you could order with the meal.  Wife had the two items above which were 'okay', and I had a seafood curry bowl and the wings.  Wings were decent and in a bit of an odd sauce.  You get 3 that include the wing and drum still attached.  The curry was the furthest thing from a curry and actually more like a 'salty' as that was all I could taste.  It came in a bowl with rice and little chunks of green beans.  Not good and didn't even have any curry (salty) sauce in the bowl.  Very unimpressed after reading decent reviews.

We both had the seared hamachi which was heavenly. The sauce helped make the dish and I had a weird love for the mushrooms that were in the dish too.

you can choose the base when you order poke (sushi rice, white rice, brown rice or soba) i ordered tuna poke with sushi rice.. got a complimentary milk tea with fresh milk (instead of salad like the other reviews)

milk tea was light/bland. they offered sugar incase you need. it is very different with fresh milk, not strong at all

its best to not pick sushi rice with the tuna. they marinate the fish with sushi rice vinegar(too much), soy sauce and sesame oil. it was very sour to eat it on its own, let alone mix it with sushi rice. the lady was nice enough to offer extra fish to balance the flav a bit (+1 for the customer service/satisfaction) overall the bowl was too sour and too much going on to enjoy.. the apple mangoes were sour, the bean curd was soaked with sauce","Business review: 2.0 Stars

The fish is incredibly fresh and well cut. The fatty pieces are handled expertly and melt in your mouth. Pieces like fresh scallop (hotate) which are mishandled most places are fantastic here.

There are a couple of pieces limited to one order per person which are really quite nice. The uni is great which is a rare find for an AYCE place.

It's pretty awesome that desserts and hot food are included as well.We got one of each dessert and split them all. The green tea ice cream was particularly tasty.

The place offers a very formal setting and assumes you are there for a long evening. For example, they don't give you the menus when you first sit down, you get to first contemplate what you want to drink. They offer some complimentary tasty bruschetta followed by some bread with balsamic vinegar a bit later. Between the starters and the main they offer a complimentary sorbet drizzled with champagne so you may clense your palette. 

The portions are massive, the prices are not modest, but the food is very tasty. Everyone I've ate with there has been pleased. The dessert card at the end is silly, especially if they turn on the sirens.

The food is fine, the waitstaff fine, but all in all a pretty anti-climactic experience. I guess I was expecting something a little more over the top, like a giant cheeseburger dancing around the aisles, passing out mustard and ketchup packets or something. 

I ordered the gardenburger with bleu cheese and bacon, but they forgot the bacon. The fries were decent, but a little flavorless.

I was happy to see that we were started off with some of the namesake bruschetta. I found the bread tasted a bit stale for my liking, but overall fairly tasty.

My appetizer was a salad with peaches, bocconcini, almost, and a balsamic mustard vinaigrette. The peaches were substituted without notice for figs, which were delicious.

My main course was the ciangale spaghetti with wild boar meatballs and truffle cheese. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful although the sauce was a little disappointing.

The panna cotta for desert was quite delicious, although it left a rather unappetizing taste in my mouth moments later. The tiramisu one of my dining companions order was apparently quite delicious.

Overall, the food was quite good, although given the price of the dishes, I would think twice about returning.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

Then the pig came out whole so we could see it and take some pictures. They cut it all up for us and started bringing out plates. They had different types of bread, including baos and different sauce although it would have been nice to have some bbq sauce which they didn't have. They sides were also included; the kale ceasar was sooo good as were the roasted root vegetables.  When we wanted more sides they were brought out no charge and at the end of the night there was pig left over which we packed up with us. 

They also let you funnel the whiskey with the pigs ear! Super fun/ a litlle gross.

None of the staff seemed overly ambitious or excited to invite some new customers in.

I couldn't tell if they just are unhappy in their jobs or if they think they're top shit and should treat their clients like they don't belong, or what the deal was.  Perhaps it was just one experience. I'll be back to try it again - because the food is worth it.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

My boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday and I ordered the bananas foster and he ordered some type of burrito. He liked his burrito, but my meal was VERY mediocre. The banana's foster had maybe a half a banana cut up on it with a little bit and super sweet syrup and really dense pancakes. It was so dense that it was chewy and made my stomach hurt. I also got a side of sausage which really wasn't sausage. I wish I had taken a picture it. It looked like they took a hamburger patty and wripped off a piece of it (it was wierdly misshapen) and just gave it to me on the plate....and it tasted like mediocre hamburger meat too :/ 

The service was pretty 'meh' too. I think the girl was new so lets cut her some slack. Oh, and the coffee was watered down and terrible. 

Overall, I wouldn't go back or recommend it.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

Only 1 person in our party of 8 was happy with their order.  Those are not good odds.  Maybe we expected too much because they were voted best in Las Vegas.  Maybe the rest of us ordered the worst things on the menu?  It is a very large menu with so many choices.  My wife ordered Pho and was disappointed.

We all ordered pho.  The pho broth here was more on the bland side or I would call it Americanize.  We definitely not craving it or anything.   

I prefer their location off Lindell and Spring Mountain better, even though the service isn't as good as this one.  I haven't been to the one off Eastern yet, from the reviews, it might be the one to try if I'm over in that area.

My one and only complaint, and it does lower the rating, is the fact that tables are close together, and also placed too close to the bar, which can make it a bit uncomfortable when it is crowded as seated and standing patrons and the busy servers have to carom off one another.

The terminal section of PIttsburgh International Airport (PIT) is composed of four concourses extending from a central zone. The airport provides a decent selection of food and shopping in the center, so it's a decent layover stop. Throughout the premise, everything's placement makes perfect sense and the restroom facilities plus water fountains are sufficient. 

If you are flying from this airport, the TSA staff here is friendly and efficient with their job, so you don't have to worry about any delay that is commonly associated with other airport checkpoints. 

Because of its history, PIT still retained its antique feel but has not failed to provide modern airport accommodations. While it is certainly not a top-notch airport, PIT is one of the few decent airports that I have been to.","Business review: 4.0 Stars

I hated it because of the Service, Food was always good but service was exceptionally slow to where it was painful just to go.

Finally relented and went back last Sunday for Brunch.  It was crowded as usual but the appear to have learned how to better manage the crowd.  When I walked in and looked at the crowd, I expected at least half and hour wait.  

We were seated in just over 15 minutes and our server was right there to give us menus and take our orders.  I had the Steak and Eggs and they came our perfect in a very reasonable amount of time.

Too early to give them an approval rating because this could have been a aberation but if they continue like this time, they are well on the their way to getting just that.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

- The waitress seemed to be overly flustered and kept giving apologies/excuses about being so busy (sorry, I can't help)

- They didn't bring out what I ordered (actually, they gave me more than what I ordered and I had to make sure I wasn't going to be charged - they ended up letting me keep the extra wings - so mixed on this point, but it could have equally been a screw up for the worst)

- Even though I ended up with some extra boneless wings they just weren't that good.

Overall, not impressed and there is little to nothing which would bring me back.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

This place would get 3 stars without serving anything.  A rather dark corner of my neighborhood has been transformed into a bright gathering place by the energy of this friendly, energetic young couple.  It's a testament to their efforts that I see crowds gather at an ice cream shop in the cold, grey depth of the Cleveland winter.

The actual product pushes Mason's over the top.  ""Grocery store grade"" ice creams beat you over the head with sweetness and flavorings.  Even some premium brands are rather intense.  THIS is the place to go if you want a true flavor experience.  After savoring pints of the Rising Star coffee and salted caramel, the thing that stands out most is the subtlety.  This is a premium product that caresses the taste buds with enticing, subtle hints of the featured ingredients on top of a solid base that is not cloyingly sweet.

Not cheap, but the ice cream equivalent of a meal prepared by a master chef.","Business review: 5.0 Stars

As he was nowhere to be found, I had to flag down the manager to ask her to cancel the order, and as I did, the waffles came. She was at least extremely apologetic and comped the waffles, but the wait was unacceptable for a simple order. Waffles themselves were good, but nothing special.

Ok, it's only fifty cents, however, given how terrible the desert water is, it is a crime that a fee is charged for filtered tap water water, this should be done as a courtesy for guests.  We're not talking sparkling or bottled water here, it's plain water from the tap.  What's next, a fee for air conditioning?

There is no mention of this charge on the menu, it just appears on ones bill.  While it is a nominal amount, my guess is that most guests overlook it, however, when one is charged $24.00 for three enchiladas, charging for tap water is borderline abuse.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

I noticed that others that ordered the same dishes were given much larger portions, and also given much more personal attention.  We stated that it was our first time, but it made no difference.

To start of on a positive note, staff here are great. They are friendly and attentive. 

Food, however, fell short of my expectations. Tried the crab and shrimp cakes, chopped salad, jerk chicken burger with fries, calamari, and jambalaya.

The crab cakes were good, but not much bigger than the size of a toonie. Chopped salad was bland. Jerk chicken burger didn't taste like jerk chicken, and fries were a bit soggy. 

Calamari was my favourite dish, ever so tender pieces drenched in fresh tomato sauce with garlic and herbs. Jambalaya was also good, rice had a great texture, with pieces of chicken and shrimp. 

I just can't justify paying ~$10 for some of the tiny portioned subpar food. 

Overall verdict: much better tapas places elsewhere, would come here for brunch to give this place a second chance.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

I came in here with my girlfriend on a Saturday. The place was busy, but it was definitely not at capacity. Even though I saw free seats, we were told to wait. We ended up waiting more than 20 minutes before we were finally told we can sit down. By the time we got a seat, we only had one chance to get everything we wanted because it was already last call. Was this the plan? 

Look, I enjoy the food. The sliced beef is great, the ribs are awesome, but combined with the usual customer service (lousy) and the prices, its just not worth it in my opinion. It came out to more than $17pp for lunchtime. I could go eat an amazing lunch elsewhere for this much money and be just as full. Not to mention, they have a well documented history with DineSafe.

Granted there are great menu selections and the food has been reliably good.  But the prices are high, the service mediocre, and the interior design more fitting of a Vegas night club.

The chicken was dried and tasted old, not fresh at all.  The miso soup that came with the bento box had dish detergent residue smell.  We ordered an extra miso soup and the waitress forgot about it.  It's not like the restaurant was busy.  There was nobody except myself and my friend. 2 People and they forgot our miso soup order.

Service is pretty bad. The waiters barely ever come around to check up on how you're doing or refill water, and most of the waiters seem anti-social which isn't the best trait for someone in the service industry to have. Am I expecting too much?

Since I partied like a rock star last week,

I wanted a more cultural dining experience.
And Hofbräuhaus def has that German feel:

a real live folk band,
communal dining tables,
servants dressed traditonally,
humongous steins of several biers,
even a Jägermeister girl who spanks?!

Yup, the shot girl asks every patron who
drinks down a Jägermeister to bend over
and accept a paddle wack to the derrière.
That's an incredibly weird public spectacle 
to watch while eating, but entertaining. (lol)

Brats are served over a plate of mashed
potatoes with ruby red colored kraut on
the side.  House specialty appetizer is a
huge pretzel with salt crystals on the top.

Lunch for my wife and I was $80, this included a number of taco's that still left us a bit hungry at the end, my wife had 3 glasses of wine, I had some Lemonaide.  I think $80 can buy better food and a better experience elsewhere.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

we ordered the one with onion, and bacon, and the one with sausages and smoked meat. both well prepared and portions are huge. one regular is good for 2 I think.

The other one was good too, but not as impressive as coconut pancakes. Definitely worth a try though.

They have a big patio, which in the summer is perfect and inside isn't too bad too. They have a huge selection of beer, a number of beers they brew themselves and then they bring a few in too.

I had everything hoppy they had on tap and I loved every bit of it. Their beers are really good and the service is great.  I'm a fan.","Business review: 4.0 Stars

We ordered our respective Ramen noodles and some Chicken Karaage and Takoyaki balls to share. The Chicken Karaage was okay. The Karaage balls looked like it came from the supermarket. My bowl of noodle was yummy and texture of the noodles was good however portion was kinda small. Service was attentive.,"Business review: 3.0 Stars
