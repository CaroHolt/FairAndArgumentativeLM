F.D.R.'s solution to this little problem was to threaten to pack the court with justices who would vote the way he wanted. Back then there was no constitutionally stipulated maximum to the number of justices that could be put on the court so long as the president nominated them and the Senate gave their consent.

With this very real threat in place, the High Court backed down, and ever since we have essentially had no limit on the powers of the federal government.

This is the single greatest threat to our country. If we don't get a handle on it soon, the great experiment in self government started by our founding fathers is going to be a distant memory.",How can politicians and Supreme Court Justices justify stepping beyond?

A conservator is a person appointed by the probate court to oversee the financial or personal affairs of an adult who has been determined to be incapable of managing his or her own affairs.

A Conservator of Person provides supervision of the personal affairs of an individual including substitute decision making to ensure that the respondent (the conserved person) has nutritious meals, clothing, safe and adequate housing, personal hygiene, and is protected from physical abuse or harm.

Look at other circumstances surrounding the absence.   FMLA would have covered your absence, as long as you met the number of hours worked.   You need to find that out.   If there are other circumstances, like you failed to call off from work for two or three days before you showed up with the Dr's excuse...or perhaps had too many absenses prior to this one.   

Regardless, you need to consult a lawyer with all of the facts.   He will advise you as to the proper recourse.   If you are uncomfortable with a lawyer, then you need to go through the Boeing appeal process, which is available through corporate Human Resources.   If they refuse that, make sure they refuse it in writing....and take that to the lawyer.

Good luck, and I hope you feel better.

Justice is incidental to law and order.  ~John Edgar Hoover

When you go into court you are putting your fate into the hands of twelve people who weren't smart enough to get out of jury duty.  ~Norm Crosby

Although the legal and ethical definitions of right are the antithesis of each other, most writers use them as synonyms.  They confuse power with goodness, and mistake law for justice.  ~Charles T. Sprading, Freedom and its Fundamentals

'Knowing' is defined as that aspect of consciousness that categorizes phenomena.

This makes it very easy for humanity, for the purpose of identification and/or definition in communication.  So humanity categorizes all varieties in all kingdoms.

But since humanity is in its infancy in knowledge (not to mention wisdom), errors in judgement in categorizing various phenomena can be expected and will always happen.  (You should read some of the stuff they have the gall to call ""science"" in anthropology and archaeology.)

You can get some instant relief, if you have a troubled mind, by reading J. A. Rogers, ""Nature Knows No Color Line"".

However, I don't believe they had any rules about whether or not the business could have a surcharge to cover their losses on the small transactions.

Businesses are charged a percentage of total transactions made on credit cards. The percentage is calculated by the average amount of each charge. For example, if your average customer charges $250, you may only pay a fraction of a percent. However, if the average customer charges only $20, you'll pay a higher percentage.

Small charges lower the average, so the business gets burned on small purchases.

What about adults who go to work and school? Are they allowed to use the bathroom? The parts of the government that deal with labor laws say yes. Labor laws state that employers must allow workers to use the bathroom. In the past, workers have sued employers that refused to allow them to use the bathroom. The courts ruled in their favor. Adults who go back to school to continue their education are allowed to get up and leave class whenever they need to get a drink or use the bathroom. They do not have to ask permission.",under indiana labor law is it legal for an employer to force you to use payed break time to use bathroom?

However, I will mention that it may be an insurance issue.  When you get homeowners insurance, they ask you if you smoke.  I guess because you are more likely to burn down your house if you do?  I dunno.  Anyway, so it may cost a lot more in insurance if the property owner rents to people who smoke in the house.

If you're in the United States, it can be very difficult to find out whether someone has a conservator.  A conservator, by the way, is a person appointed by the court to handle the finances of a person with serious life challanges.  (As opposed to a guardian, who essentially makes ALL choices for the ward).  Conservators are generally appointed by court order of state courts.  So you need to figure out where this person has lived, when he might have been appointed a conservator, and call the local courthouse to see if a conservatorship was filed for under his name.

Hope that helps!

 Councilman: Raise smoking age to 21 
                                         By Chuck Bennett 

Young New Yorkers would have to wait until they are 21 to legally buy their first pack of cigarettes if a controversial City Council bill is signed into law. 


All tobacco-related goods, including cigars, chewing tobacco, rolling papers and pipes, would be off-limits to people under 21. 

The bill's sponsor, Joel Rivera of the Bronx, the Democratic majority leader and chairman of the council health committee, said raising the age would cut down on teen smoking and ""improve the general health of all New Yorkers."" 


Rivera is expected to announce another piece of legislation today, which is World No Tobacco Day. His bill would ban all flavored cigarettes -- except menthol and clove -- in the five boroughs.",Is NY state banning clove cigarettes?  Which legislator introduced the legislation and why?

You need to look carefully at your actions and what it is that you are doing that would make him feel like you are stalking him.  Following somebody or driving past their work or home over and over again is very much stalking activity.  Repeated phone calls, emails and letters are also stalking behaviors.  If you do not have an ongoing relationship with this person, be careful how you interact with him.

And the advice to get a restraining order is not a good idea.  Stalkers are often people looking for control over their victims.  Applying for a restraining order would only look more controlling.

I would suggest that; after evaluating your behavior, you do your best to avoid this person.  You don't have to go out of your way.

The criminal option is possible, if you give the police a complaint. But the criminal angle also varies by state, and not all states have criminal laws that address this situation.

However many factories have been creating safety policies that forbid the wearing of jewelry on the manufacturing floor because they pose a potential for being caught in machinery.  Rings and earrings caught in machinery have contributed to many industrial accidents, so that is a legitimate cause for concern.

There is also a concern for wearing jewelry around food processing machinery but that is less for safety and more to reduce the potential for contamination.

Places that do metal plating or that work with nickel or manufacture stainless steel tend to discourage their employees from having piercings or body jewelry because the employee runs the risk of sensitivity to the metal over time (nickel is the most common) and that would be an occupational exposure. 

So while OSHA may not regulate jewelry in the workplace, many companies who have a ""beyond compliance"" safety culture may prohibit employees from wearing jewelry out of concern for their employees.",OSHA regulations pertaining to ear rings/piercings?

If so, the immediate concern is to file for post-conviction relief. This procedure is generally the means by which a convicted person can challenge the conviction after the appeals have run.
Whether it is a criminal matter or a civil matter, malpractice is generally a tort matter, and most states have statutes of limitations for torts at one year. Most states... The year begins to run at the time of the malpractice, so you need to check your calendar on that. Also, you may have an action for breach of contract. Generally, the statutes of limitation for breach of contract runs longer than that for torts.

It depends on the case as far as if she has to testify or not. The judge can make her come to court and testify by issuing a subpoena (which should be delivered by mail and/or a cop knocking on the door). If she chooses NOT to go to court even though a subpoena was issued she can be in BIG trouble and action can be taken against her. 

If she doesn't want to testify she should go to the court house (as soon as possible) and get information from the District Attorney, Clerk of Court and/or the prosecuting attorney in determining whether she has to testify or not.","do victims,or witiness have to testify at a criminal trial?"

Preventing crime avoids multiple kinds of cost:
* cost for the damage the crime did
* cost for the prosecution
* cost for the penal system

Add these together and you will see that these costs are in most cases higher than the cost for social programs that help avoid crime.

The only little issue with prevention is:
The cost of prevention is one large chunk out of the public coffers. The cost of crime is payed by public (prosecution and penal system) and private money (damage).
Since the cost of damage is normally covered by the victim or the victim's insurance people don't see this part of the cost of crime clearly. So they tend to disregard it.",Is an ounce of prevention really worth a pound of cure?

July 31, 2001.

Neighbors brought declaratory judgment action against landowner and his successors, seeking permanent injunction to stop landowner from dedicating land to city and to stop city from constructing roadway on land. Following a bench trial, the Superior Court, Maricopa County, No. CV 99-90519, M. Jean Hoag, J., denied the request for an injunction. Neighbors appealed. The Court of Appeals, Garbarino, P.J., held that: (1) neighbors were owners of lot and had right to enforce subdivision's restrictions, and (2) roadway was a structure, and thus was prohibited by the restrictions.

Malicious intent is supposedly the hardest part to prove.

I would say that in your case, you would have a rather easy time proving malicious intent because the offender has a clear motivate to attempt to smear your reputation.

* Fiscal Year *

FISCAL YEAR - This is an accounting year, i.e. when the books for the year are opened and closed. It can coorespond to the calander year or be say, July 1 to June 30, as many governments have it.

The accounting period for which annual financial statements are regularly prepared, generally a period of 12 months, 52 weeks, or 53 weeks.

Financial operations of the federal government are carried out in a 12-month fiscal year, beginning on Oct. 1 and ending on Sept. 30. The fiscal year carries the date of the calendar year in which it ends. (From fiscal year 1844 to fiscal year 1976, the fiscal year began July 1 and ended the following June 30.)","why financial year is from April to march, not the calender year.?"

Expressed contract is there is an offer, an acceptance and consideration - meaning something you get or something I give up in exchange for performance.

An implied contract is a contract which is determined by conduct rather that words.  For example, if I pay you $5 every time you shovel my driveway, even though we never said a word to each other, you might expect that I would pay you $5 next time you shovel my driveway.

Promissory estoppel is something altogether different.  It is a substitute for consideration.  For example, if I make a charitable pledge to a church, and others do as well, even though the church gave me nothing for the promise, I am estopped to deny my pledge because of the performance of everyone else who gave there pledge.

I forced the agent to get a letter from the household company acknowledging that the policy was secondary.

No reduction in premium, but it avoide the problem of co-insurance, deductibles, absence of new-for-old and other stuff that the forced insurance didn't offer but the renters policy did.

2.If congress did not speak:
      a. Check if the Agency has reasonably resolved the precise issue? If the agency's interpretation is unreasonable, or impermissible -- based on other congressional intent or on Constitution -- remand it back to the agency so that the agency can change it.
      b. If the congress has explicitly delegated the policy to the agency,  the agency is allowed any policy as long AS it reasonably serves the purpose of the statute, But it can still be stricken down if it is  arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the statute.

In the U.S., there are at least four types of law.  These are constitutional law, statutes, regulations, and common law.  Common law covers those situations where there isn't a Constitutional provision, statute, or regulation to look to, but there are still people before the court who claim that they've been harmed.  It is judge-made law, some published, some not.  Types of common law include contract law, property law, and tort law.  This isn't to say that the only thing that matters for contract, property, or tort disputes is judge-made law, but rather that most law in this area happens to be judge made.  Common law is considered more flexible than any other type of law, a continual adaptation of the law to meet our evolving social expectations.  Other people see it as judicial tyranny, since no-one elects federal judges.

Hope that helps!

If registration is made within 3 months after publication of the work or prior to an infringement of the work, statutory damages and attorney's fees will be available to the copyright owner in court actions.

If the decedent is not survived by a spouse, descendant, or parent, intestate property passes to brothers and sisters and their descendants.

Typically a grand jury is seated for a long period (3 months or more) and meets periodically to hear a prosecutor's evidence.  The prosecutor gets to put on his evidence before the grand jury without rebuttal from a defense attorney or a defendant, so grand juries very often vote to indict as they have heard only one side of the case.  Keep in mind that a grand jury does not vote on guilt or innocence, just whether the state has enough evidence to bring a case to trial.

If there's something more you think the lawyer should know, ask if he or she wants to know about whatever it is... be guided by their answer.

Assuming you're discussing a criminal case, the issue for the lawyer won't necessarily be whether you're guilty, but rather whether the state can prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, using evidence gathered within the restrictions of law.

If you're discussing a civil matter, the rules aren't much different.","When you retain an attorney, do you tell them the absolute truth? Guilt and all?"

Okay, this is a stab in the dark because I don't know Arizona law, but I think it's a fairly educated stab in the dark.

You're not a blood relative.  CPS has jurisdiction over this kid but for whatever reason placed the child with you (are you a licensed foster parent?).  Since CPS has jurisdiction, and since you're not a blood relative, I would strongly suspect that you have no rights as to this child whatsoever, no matter what the biological mother wants.

Ultimately, CPS is responsible for this child while it is in state custody and that means they get to call the shots.  You certainly can hire an attorney to look into the matter; I'm just telling you what I strongly suspect will be the outcome.  Perhaps not the definitive answer, but I'd bet I'm pretty close to being on the money.",failure to thrive cps took the same baby they gave me knowing he was born with problems Why???? please help?
