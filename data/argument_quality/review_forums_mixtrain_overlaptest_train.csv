One of the few pho locations in East Markham, it's not a terrible choice, but it most definitely isn't the best choice.

I was pretty disappointed to find that the soup base wasn't flavourful; just really salty and oily, with a lack of any real beef flavour. The noodles were kinda clumped. As for the seafood soup with noodles; it just didn't have a lot of seafood? And the seafood that was there was pretty low grade and low quality. I was also really disappointed to find that they didn't serve rice wrap spring rolls; a staple to Vietnamese cuisine, in my humble opinion.

I had the garlic chicken. Delicious! It cleaned my nose right out (spicy). It was derived very fast, too. My colleague enjoyed his lunch, too. 

You can get fresh fish, lobster, crab, etc as they have them there! Prices are posted on the wall no no surprises. 

The waitress was not that sensitive to the fact we were working gents on lunch break so she was about as laid back as the senior citizens that were dining in at the same time we were. Always kept the water full, though.

The most appalling part came after we paid the bill. I have no issue tipping, but it is something that is earned, not an entitlement. We felt our experience was poor and the tip reflected that. As we were leaving, the same waitress ran after us claiming we did not tip enough. When we started explaining why we didn't,  she walked away before we finished our sentence and said forget it.

Whenever I get the opportunity, I try to go there and bring friends and family.  It is incredibly deceptive in its appearance as it doesn't look like much from the outside and is in kind of a seedy looking strip mall.  I just park near the lights and remember to hide anything valuable.

There can be a bit of a long wait depending on how many people are waiting (a bit of a gamble on when to go).  However, it is always well worth it.  

I love that the food is representative of so many different places and regions.  I love the Yellow Curry and the staple I always order at every Thai restaurant, Pad Thai.  The curry isn't soupy but a good consistency and the Pad Thai is delicious as well.  While the portions can be a bit small compared to other places (I'm 6'0, 190), three dishes is usually enough for 2 of us easy.","Business review: 5.0 Stars

I also ate breakfast there and when I received the bacon, it was cold, not good ""since I'm a meat and potatoes"" guy and grew up in the Midwest.

I have eaten here several times and here are some of the things I recommend: 

French onion soup, wings (especially the parmesean sause), and the artichoke dip

Do not recommend: loaded nachos (way too greasy), char grilled wings of any kind (very dry and over cooked).

I have never had a burger here but it looks HUUUUUUUGE, and i definetly want to try one, at some point when I come here and i'm starving.

Meal started off very well, the chips and salsa where very tasty! The chips are thin and crispy, the salsa is a little runny, but overall was good (disclaimer I was starving when I got there so that probably helped).

The chicken fajitas were average. The skillet did come out sizzling, which was a very positive start. With that said, there was a ton of onions to peppers ratio on the skillet (I am more of a peppers person), but it could have just been my skillet. The chicken was also average, some pieces were a little rubbery and I felt that it could have used a bit more flavor/spices.

No a huge fan of the guac that came with the fajitas. It did not taste right, I'm not sure what exactly was off, but just a heads up if you plan to order that as an app.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

The customer next to me was also complaining about her hot dog being too spicy and I noticed that her bun was also burnt on the outside.

I would suggest that they re-evaluate the seasonings that they use and prep the chicken better prior to cooking. In the end I ended up only eating the rice because sadly that was the only thing I could stomach.

What I got was a very small amount of turkey, even less Swiss, a quarter size piece of unripe tomato, a tiny dot of onion on some unknown bread with no mustard. Basically a lettuce and bread sandwich. Service was extremely slow. I'm being kind when I say the D team was at 12:30 pm today.

You can hear and see parts of the kitchen and it's obvious that your meal is prepared freshly when ordered.  We usually order a variety of dishes and share everything.  The cold rolls, the tom yum soup and the pad thai are all done really well here.  My favourite dish is the red curry chicken, cooked with coconut milk and lots of vegetables.

We were two families with young children. Arrived around 5. Drink orders were taken swiftly and appetizers followed quickly. Sadly, nothing else about our experience there was swift.

Our server was pleasant enough but every step of our dining process took longer than typical. He did not ask for options for kids meals and did not offer dessert (that comes with the meal). Food was average. Beef brisket had nice smokey flavour but was extremely fatty. Chicken fingers were dry and overfried, and left uneaten by my toddler. Fish and chips were just okay but better places for that nearby. 

All in all, not keen to return. And definitely not with kids! Service for families was superior at Against the Grain.  It's too bad as it is a nice space.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

Assuming that it was run by the same people, I expected an enjoyable dining experience tonight. Well ...  Arisu is apparently run by another owner and has no ties to former Miga in any way, shape, or form. 

As it's called an izakaya, I expected a lot of Japanese tapas with a selection of drafts on tap. The quintessential yakitori sticks were nowhere to be found. The bar menu was scant and pricey. The Korean BBQ was bland and rubbery.

My experience here was hardly worth the price I paid. It doesn't cost an arm and a leg, but the bill is still substantial.","Business review: 1.0 Stars

Honey Garlic - self explanatory, it's hard to mess up this flavour and all stars does not mess it up

Caesar Does Texas - creamy garlic and parm with some chipotle, one of my favourites, highly recommend this flavour

Nero's Epilogue - basically a much spicier version of Caesar Does Texas, if you like a kick with your garlic parm this is the flavour to get.

This is simply roast chicken done well, sides that are fine.
I have yet to try the ribs, but I will.

I have been a few times, have found service spotty. Sometimes it is awesome, some times not so awesome. I get it, we all have off days.

I have ordered chicken with sides, and salads with chicken. I think I prefer the salads.
But MAYBE when I dive into  a plate of ribs, I might change my mind!

Normally I wouldn't order dumplings at a restaurant since I find the frozen ones from the supermarket to be decent enough. After dining here I'll never get frozen dumplings again. The steamed dumplings are my go to since you have the soup pour out when you bite into it and they're perfectly plump. The dumpling wrapper is perfect! I've found that the other dumpling restaurants I've been to in chinatown always have wrappers that are too thick.

Personally I did not find a plate of dumplings and an order of the egg drop soup to be enough for two people but I'm sure the fried dumplings are more filling with the grease. Highly recommend trying the steamed dumplings here!","Business review: 5.0 Stars

From what I can tell, the place is focused on the country-bar aspect rather than the food.  It seems like a popular place in the evenings, with live music and dancing, and gets pretty crowded.

However, I went for lunch, and got the barbecue beef sandwich.  Kind of disappointing that a cowboy place wouldn't have decent barbecue.  This seemed eerily similar to the Lloyds barbecue beef that you get at the grocery store, except maybe not as rich - I'm not saying Lloyds is bad, it's just not restaurant quality.

From 11:30-12:00, there were only three customers including myself, which tells me that this is definitely not a lunch place.  So if you're considering going to hang out at the bar or do some line dancing, I'm sure the rest of the reviewers here will steer you right.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

I was out with my husband recently and we stopped into Moosehead. It seemed like a laid back environment. That's until we heard the owner and friends making comments (I'll refrain from the specifics) about Jewish people. 
My husband and I being a Jewish couple from New York confronted the owner. He defended what was said and pretty much told us to get used to it because we are down in the south. Not a place I want to spend my evenings in Charlotte.

Ordered chicken strips, and they were seasoned so well. Then I ordered the Pan Seared Chicken with a garlic sauce and oven roasted tatoes greenbeans and carrots. My date had the Open Prime Rib Sandwich with garlic mashed potatoes.  We were overly impressed with the taste of the dinner choices.  Not to mention that they have a shot drink menu of 101 different mixed shots, that come in a shaker that have about 3 more shots for about 8 bucks.

There was a live band playing cover songs, and the staff was friendly. I'm already planning my next visit with my sis and the girls from work.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

I'll point out that our server was great - quick, helpful, friendly. But she had horrible food to contend with. Her tip was for her service and not the food as are any points on the rating.

We also got an order of fries that came out cold and were just below mediocre.

The place was really warm, which could be attributed to the summer heat, but we were sitting inside, so there is a fair assumption that air conditioning would be involved.

I'll pass next time my coworkers are planning a trip here. I'd be better off eating at McDonald's.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

Do you fancy candy? 

Delicious sweets and treats?

Well this high end can store is for you. I can't comment on the restaurant yet but I'll for sure be trying it out soon. I'm mostly here for the gelato and delicious shakes. Located right in front of the Paris hotel just underneath the Eiffel Tower and facing towards the Bellagio fountains. I honestly wouldn't pay premium for their fancy candy and their swag. 

It's a great experience to visit Sugar Factory and play tourist. The staff on the other hand are eye candy themselves, heh. Above Sugar Factory is the Chateau Club by Paris Las Vegas and it's connected directly to the Paris Casino.

Mine one star for the tourist trap prices 
Minus another star for no outdoor seating.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

The hush puppies were light and airy. The mac and cheese was the only thing that didn't really stand out. The pecan cobbler was a home run. Do not attempt to eat it on your own. I did, and I failed miserably. It is sweet, warm with a maple syrupy type sauce that leaves you yearning for fall to get here already!

We ordered the veggie noodle bowl with thin noodles and the spicy beef brisket bowl with thick regular noodles. 

Here are some of my take backs:

1. The thin noodles not so good for a noodle soup because it absorbs all the soup so it becomes really mushy.

2. The veggie broth wasn't terrible but tasted a lot like sesame oil. The spicy beef brisket broth wasn't spicy at all, and honestly tasted like the satay spice you get from Chinese grocery markets. Which reminded me a lot like what my dad used to make as a child. So not very impressed. 

I think for people who didn't grow up eating Chinese noodles made by their parents will find this place good, but for me it was mediocre.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

What's inspiring me to write this right now is a recent lunch. It was absolutely frigid outside and a nice bowl of ramen was just what the doctor ordered. I had a spicy ground chicken ramen bowl with bok choi, scallions and a perfectly poached egg. For me, the soup was singing my favourite song and it warmed me from the inside out. We also had some pickled vegetables to kick things off- not as thrilling, but crisp and fresh. 

The atmosphere is casual. The chairs have no backs and service can be hit and miss depending on the rush. But pro tip: if it's too busy to get a table right away, just pop a squat in the lobby of the Shangri-La Hotel. If you're lucky, you'll be serenaded by piano.","Business review: 4.0 Stars

An update to my previous reviews after coming back here for several occasions.

*Update #2* Got the brick toast again and this time around it was under toasted and the bread itself was very dry. Totally different experience from what I had the first time. Looks like the quality is not consistent and may depend on who is making it at the time. I do hope that the staff is provided with proper instructions and training on how to make these things consistently. And if they are, then whoever made it is definitely not paying attention to the details.

Drinks could be a little bit more consistent as well. I usually order the passion fruit like with basil seeds. Each time it was somewhat different in terms of flavour and the amount of toppings. Taste wise it is still enjoyable.

On a more positive note, it's a cozy little place to sit and relax. You can bring board games etc. They also have decks of cards, uno etc available.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

Thai cold rolls were the best part of the meal, with fresh, crunchy veggie filling, even if the rice wrap was a bit on the tough and rubbery side.

We also ordered pad thai, coconut (""Tom Kar"") soup, panang curry, and cashew nuts shrimp. All four dishes delivered on flavour, but were incredibly over-salted, judging from the amount of water we both consumed afterward.

The lamb tikka marsala was something else.  The lamb was very soft and tender.  Obviously slow cooked.  The sauce was excellent and had deep flavors.  The basmati rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Probably the best tikka marsala I've had in Phoenix.","Business review: 5.0 Stars

The Shawarma Combo is the most wonderful explosion of wondrous flavor ever! I eat lots of shawarma and even make my own. The combo for two is quite exceptional to the point of being rather excellent, quite possibly even outstanding!

I get the pot of Turkish coffee and the tiramisu for desert for the best finale ever.

We ended up all the way at the club and having to turn right back out take a taxi back to the hotel will definitely dine here again but I hope I don't run into her because I'm still bee upset.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

They have gone to bigger wings but they were way over cooked and dry and it seems as though they were trying to cover that fact up with all the sauce.

Our waitress was friendly and attentive, despite the dinnertime rush, and the wings and the fish tacos we ordered were both tasty and reasonably priced. And the dessert hit the spot just right. However, I've had some lackluster experiences here in the past. I wouldn't recommend their Saturday Night Prime Rib; it was very fatty with the fat still ""under-cooked"" (not that it was raw, but it had that dull yellowish color and it was chewy) and the meat itself was pale and gray. I haven't had any outright negative experiences here though.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

The menu is really extensive. A step up from Congee Queen as they even offers fresh lobsters and fish that are still swimming in the tank.

Here you do get value as the portion size is huge. Make sure you don't order too much! But you can always have leftovers as lunch the next day.

The quality of the food is quite standard in a good way. And everyone would find something they enjoy.

The interior is spacious and well laid out. High ceiling and comfortable seating. 

I would be back again for a late dinner (closes at 11 pm) or even afternoon tea special when I am in the area, There are not too many good decent restaurant in the area so Mr. Congee would be doing well.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

Food were served and we start to dig in. As a big fan of ramen I'm so excited to try the broth. Broth needs more flavor and the noodles was okay. Overall, taste of the ramen is bland.  There was no kick, no impact, and no special thing about the ramen.

Of the six salads, three did not have Caesar dressing. We flagged the waiter who said that it was probably at the bottom of our salad. Then he went back and told us that he checked with the kitchen and that we were wrong but he brought dressing for us anyway.

They also were attentive throughout our meal, checking in with us regularly and they made sure that our water glasses never went empty.

The food... I had the Chicken Pad Thai.  It was good, but nothing that wowed me.  A little too sweet for me (and I typically go for sweeter foods).  I will opt for the Panang Curry next time.

The drinks... I ordered a Thai tea to go with my Pad Thai and that was very goodA  I would definitely order that from Thai Long-An again.

Won't come back for the restaurant, but may be back for the lounge which sounds great.

I had to ask them to cook the pork belly more because it was not crispy and full of fat.  I love fat but I need it a little more cooked and not soft and white. 
The other ""silogs"" were alright.  What I want to rave about is the eggs.  I asked it to be cooked scrambled and the flavor was delicious.  

Unfortunately, the pancit was not good at all.  It lacked flavor and needed either soy sauce (which they had Aloha Shoyou) or patis.  

Overall, my score would've been between 2-3.

4. Good variety of spicy food & so many LAMB dishes!

But the only problem is the girls that work up in the front are a little ignorant to people and for it being so early in the morning not a lot of people really want to deal with that. One time my mom asked the girl if she could borrow a pen the girl looked at her said she didn't have one yet they had a whole bunch of pens in a holder....gee..what great service. The waiters are great!!! they always are on top of their game and of course since we are regulars they love to talk to us. We have told them about the girls but I think this is a perfect way to put them on blast! If you are working at a place that considers great customer service (obviously everywhere) then fake a smile and put that nasty attitude away. Being rude is not good customer service. Other than that go to Butter Fields! they have the best food of course :),"Business review: 1.0 Stars

Summer 2016

I'm cheap when it comes to shoes and purses, but with pastries I'm a freakin' baller. I LOVE breads and desserts from Bouchon, that's where I'd spend my dollar dollar bill, y'all! 

In this review, I'm going to focus on their macarons, the French sandwich cookie (NOT macarOOns, the cookies with coconut). I get irritated when people label their cookie pics incorrectly. 

It's hard to resist macarons, airy and delicately crisp, so I bought a box of six minis and six large ones (buy 5, get one free). I love the sweet, creamy filling but their flavors were not very exciting - vanilla, chocolate, pistachio, salted caramel,  raspberry. How about matcha tea? Blueberry? Black Sesame? Or how about Champagne? They need more colorful macarons!Nevertheless, I enjoyed the French cookies but I don't need to get two boxes next time. I'd rather stock up on the breads.

First, everything is a triumph of form over funtion: the soup bowls are wide and shallow so the soup gets cold, it is impossible to spoon out the soup and the spoon keep sliding into the bowl.  And second all of their restaurants are always noisy.  Partly this is because there are no soft services to absorb the sound but today the place was almost empty and it was still noisy because they had the sound system cranked up.  I have no idea what the music was -- all I could hear was a thumping base line.

Food was good, but not fantastic. Price did not correspond to size.  Each plate is only a few bites.  Good food, but no bargain.  Not even a good value.  

Maybe I would give it 4 stars for the setting but service was 2 star so overall it is 3 star experience.   

Service was ambivalent at best. They were not crowded (I can see why), but I had to call the waitress every time just to get her attention. She would walk right by and not see if I needed to place my order or if I needed anything.  Not even a glance.   She poured wine in such a hurry while looking elsewhere.  Food was thrown down on the table.   It is rare to encounter this kind of service anywhere, let alone a pricey place.

My second issue was the quality of the meat that they used. We ordered a sweat and sour fish and a pad Thai with duck. In both cases the meat was dry, rubbery and not too tasty. It really seemed like a quality of meat that you would find in the frozen food section of Super C. Given the aforementioned priciness of the dishes this surely is in appropriate.  

We also ordered a tofu with crispy spinach and peanut butter sauce which was good. In all cases the vegetable, noodles and tofu component of the dishes were good.

DO NOT EAT HERE.

Update:  Someone from Rainforest corporate messaged me two days ago and asked for my phone number , said they wanted to talk to me.  I replied right away with my number.     They never called me.   Double fail.","Business review: 1.0 Stars

Yes, this thing was the size of a duffle bag!  

It was 4-star good!  They don't skimp on the stuffing, the crust was tasty, and the sauce tasted very home-made.  They had several pizzas by the slice for sale, each one looked very yummy and as reported by others, the slices are giant!!  

Overall, the food was good, the staff was friendly, the place was very clean, and locals must like it too because there was a steady stream of people picking up orders.  

I'm giving it 4 stars because, while quite good, it wasn't the ""best"" I've ever had and the atmosphere was lacking a little.","Business review: 4.0 Stars

This is their soft opening. We had a 6:30 reservation and waited 15 mins for our table at the bar. My cocktail was the lamara pesca which tasted like San pelligrino. We had Zucchini frittes and beef tartare to start. We tried the squid ink rigatoni and the pecherri pasta. We had the salted caramel budino for dessert. There was quite a wait for the food but like I said this was a soft opening so I would come back to try more on the menu. Our server was friendly. I'd like to come back for the tasting menu and more desserts. It's just not one of my favorites I've tried in the area,"Business review: 3.0 Stars

You can sit down in the restaurant and have a decent menu available to you or you can order from the counter.  The latter is better, over priced smaller bites.  The former has a wider selection - Vegas strip priced diner food.

for our entree, we ordered the famous duck in a can and plogue a champlain. the duck really was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. the fois gras on the other hand was too sweet - there was too much glaze sauce that it overpowered the dish.

Parking is inconvenient, and far away, but free.  If you are staying at a hotel on the strip, you could probably care less, but navigating the Mandalay Parking and hiking to the Mandalay Place is definitely a drawback compared to other restaurants.

The new location opened just down the street and after reading some reviews my family and I decided to give it a try for breakfast. This was very much your typical greasy spoon breakfast and I would say that I have had much better breakfast else where in the neighborhood. We were seated within 8 minutes of walking in however the total time was over an hour and a half. It took what seemed forever to get out 4 food items and it was not worth the wait. Everyone's plate was cold and eggs over cooked. Kids did not like the pancakes and I would say they are not very good either. This place offers nothing special and not worth the long wait for cold food.,"Business review: 2.0 Stars

It's been a restaurant since at least the 1940s ... I like that they've kept the older furnishings.

You can get fresh mussels.  Damian, the owner, was shucking some

Gord ordered a Breakfast Burrito (with no avocado).  He said it was delicious and would get it again.

I ordered a Reuben sandwich (without sauerkraut or cheese ... so a smoked meat sandwich) and it was good.  The bread was lightly toasted and delicious.  The meat was hot and salty.  It was really filling and I'd get it again.  I also got a Diet Coke and it came in a wee bottle

This place is like some hip twenty somethings moved into an old Victorian Hotel and decorated it with all the cool treasures they found inside. 

There were plenty of places to sit with friends and have a conversation with them, including the patio which they could smoke while I drank champagne. There was a DJ playing music, but where it was before Midnight it was pretty standard dance fare - but there was a lot of dancing going which is always a bonus. I was only paying $8-10 a drink for wine and champagne so for me it was cheaper than drinking at the strip casinos. Bar staff was friendly, people around us were cool to talk to.

I went in on Christmas Eve not knowing what to expect and boy it was busy...I guess some important games were on.  Very loud but that is my fault for not enjoying the games...no stars lost were lost for that.  I notice it is not very clean..I mean it passes a quick visual but once you are sitting there for a minute you kinda notice for the area of town it doesn't really fit. I wouldn't call this a pub or even a grill.  I call it a bar.  With bar food.  Not great.  I had a burger...so soggy it soaked through the bun.  Bleh.  I say pass on by...for the price the atmosphere and food are definitely not worth it.,"Business review: 2.0 Stars

My real issue was the server at the counter. Not my assigned server, but the stringy haired brunette with the Santa Claus cap who's hair was not tied back and she ate at the counter, during her shift, in front of patrons and didn't wash her hands after. And she ate with her fingers and kept waving her hair back and forth. Girl, you ain't Beyonce or Becky. Yeah...

Then our server didnt show up. About 15 minutes in I stood by the half empty bar watching the bartender chat someone up for 5 more minutes. Finally he came over and asked if he could help. I put in an order for 2 drinks and he told me we should order them from our server. So 20 minutes in I watched two servers and the hostess point at us from near the kitchen and argue, hopefully about which one was going to come to our table. Then they all went their separate ways.

I asked the kitchen for some aioli to add to my very dry sandwich.  They said that they had run out of aioli and offered me mayo.

The wait to eat on new years eve was not terrible. Maybe 30-45 min.
We went around brunch time and the service was better than many people gave them credit for.

The food selection seemed very limited compared to the wynn and bellagio.  But that wasn't even what I was most disappointed with,  the food quality lacked majorly in flavor.  I think the only meat worth eating there was their kilbasa sausage. Pork was over cooked and skin was hard to even cut with their huge bulky dull knife, tri tip was very over done, and their chorizo sausage had no spice.

They had an Italian section which I expected to have all sorts of pastas, instead there was maybe 4 kinds of pizza and spaghetti.

I think my husband and I come here every other weekend for breakfast, and there's always a good turnout here.

You really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, but I will say, every time I get my eggs, they are perfectly cooked! The bacon is always crispy, the hash browns are plentiful, and the coffee isn't terrible. Their French toast is simple, just like how you'd make it at home, but without the hassle and the mess in your own kitchen.  

If you want a good, cheap, simple breakfast, you can't go wrong with Carolina Family Restaurant!","Business review: 4.0 Stars

I came here for lunch with a large group and thought a review was in order. I wanted to start by saying this is lunch review as I feel that Don's dinner and lunch are two different ball games. While I think Don's is great, it isn't worth the price you pay to be honest. The lunch scene is a little different though. 

I had a turkey rueben as this is a lunch fav of mine. It was great. Big rich pieces of turkey and all the traditional Rueben flavor to boot. It was reasonably priced and I felt a good value for the quality actually. I was very impressed and the service was good as usual.

Don's atmosphere is always cool and its old time feel is refreshing. When you are always surrounded by ultra trendy and modern, it is nice to slow down a bit. Overall, I was very impressed and much more likely to come back to here for lunch as opposed to dinner.","Business review: 4.0 Stars

When we arrived the hostess seemed less than thrilled to seat us and had a poor demeanor when we requested to sit by the water (there was an abundance of seating by the water). After being seated, we were given water and our waitress disappeared. We sat waiting to place our order for approximately ten minutes. Our waitress also had a lack luster attitude when we placed our order and was not too enthusiastic to take our order. We have been waiting for over 20 minutes to get our food and I doubt it will be arriving anytime soon. As we sit back and watch the staff, there appears to be a lack of enthusiasm with all the staff. We won't be coming back. The service is awful and I doubt the food is worth the wait. #servicesucks #wheresthemanager","Business review: 1.0 Stars

-Food: They have a wide selection but no one in my party of 3 were complimenting the food. In fact, my lobster pasta upset my stomach. :(
-Prices: High for the quality
-Ambiance: Nothing to write home about (there are way better places in Vegas)
-Staff: It took longer than expected to be seated and then to get our order taken. The waitress was friendly though. 
-Location: It's conveniently in the Westgate Hotel and walking distance of the Convention Center.

Wanted my daughter to try it took less than 5 min to cook wow that was fast
That was the worst didn't have the Teri smell
The meat had no taste  you could taste the after meat taste felt sorry for my daughter because it was done half ass

Would not recommend for almost $20 for 2 bowls that fricken food better taste like I went to Korea

First, my only complaint:  It can be difficult to reach the bakery over the phone.  This is especially true if no one from Chase hospitality is there to transfer my call. 

HOWEVER, the friendly staff have been super helpful with providing me an email address (for when I need to pre-order a dozen sandwiches the night before a big morning meeting).  

The food is not only beautiful, but quite delicious.  I love that their breakfast sandwich (a large egg patty, cheese, bacon, arugula and garlic aioli mixed with homemade salsa verde on a massive sesame bun) is only $4. 

Every time I walk in, I dream about one day sitting down on their patio for some coffee and pastries !!!","Business review: 4.0 Stars

It is faster than, say Subway, because you don't get to pick your toppings as you walk along the sneeze guard. The bread is different than most chains, which differentiates them from the others. 

If you are looking for an eggwashed(?) bread, this is your place. The meats/cheeses/toppings don't stand out. The speediness does. Napkins and straws are harder to get than you'd think if you are eating inside. 

The bread looks nice, and has its uniqueness to stand on - but I don't see this place as a Subway-killer.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

Most recently I was here for dinner and ordered the evening special filet mignon with a wine demi glace. The steak was cooked just as I ordered but the demi glace tasted like cheap bbq sauce - just yuk. The vegetables that came with my meal were terribly overcooked and not good. We also ordered an appetizer or stuffed mushrooms and it was also overcooked and really not very good. The amount of cheese that topped the mushrooms was overwhelming such that you couldn't even taste the mushroom. In the past I've ordered salad or bruschetta and they were fine but also not great. The bruschetta bread was so hard that it hurt the roof of my mouth. Stick to salad and drinks here.,"Business review: 2.0 Stars

There are so many pizza places and the concept of the café and pizzeria didn't wow me.  But I ordered the Joe special, a chicken schawarma and fries on a Sunday afternoon and couldn't have been more pleased.  The pie was awesome - great chewy crust, tons and tons of toppings and a nice white sauce.  The chicken was really well seasoned, the pita was more of a tortilla, but the cucumber sauce was right on point.  But what really stood out were the fries.  Fries at a pizza place?  I have a toddler and toddlers love fries and ketchup more than life itself, so in order to appease said toddler, I always order fries just in case.  In most cases, delivery fries are sub-par - kind of soggy, not flavorful.  However, these were crunchy and very good.  They reminded me of Burger King fries.  They were a big hit!","Business review: 4.0 Stars
