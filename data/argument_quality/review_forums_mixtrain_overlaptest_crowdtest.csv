Once we didn't leave after she stated that, she proceeded to make a smart remark to convince us to leave. After she said that, we all left and took our business elsewhere. I don't know why this place is 24 hours if they're not able to function. We went while there was one other customer there! This place was not even busy, if it was busy I would understand why they had no plates. But if they had one other customer in the building, I don't understand why they had no plates.

Pricing is tricky, as sometimes the things you order and get doesn't show up, but there's a fixed charge on your bill. It would be better to see individually, but since it's all-you-can-eat, it's only one. Plus, this night, there was a lot of wrong orders. Things that one table ordered went to another table and vice versa. Sushi was good though, but I felt like they charged us more than what we got and ordered.","Business review: 3.0 Stars

The place is a restaurant, cafe and a boutique which is convenient in case you have to wait as you can get a coffee at the counter and take a look at the small boutique. The menu is very special and not traditional. They have a breakfast and lunch section as well as a small brunch one. The meals are unique, combining interesting ingredients together as well as different textures, and the tastes and flavors are really good. We had the Israeli couscous and salmon salad to share and I had the frittata with tuna for main dish. Both were excellent. 
The place is nicely decorated, with a lot of white and plants, it is spacious and the acoustic is good.

-Full Montagu..Beef and turkey..Its a very tasty sandwich .
-Holiday Turkey..Wow it taste like a turkey plate with stuffing, turkey and cranberry. Very good if you like turkey.

-Original...Just Ok..Its beef sandwich and it was nothing special.

Usually stick to either Full Montagu or Holiday Turkey.
All sandwiches are under $7 so what a deal!!!

They also have salads and soups.

Their ranch tastes homemade and is very good. Note that this is the kind of place where the bartenders/waitresses know most folks and when we were there, we happened to be sitting in someone's ""regular"" booth and the group of dads were playing fantasy football with their kids (???) so we felt the need to split so the gang could sit together.

The salad bar was well stocked and had every veggie you possible could have needed, plus endless slices (still in the shell) of avocado which is a great addition. Plus, there is a waitress who refills drinks and brings you your choice of famous cheese toast or rolls or in my case both and you can get more of either. The cheese toast is pretty addicting.

The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc.

The crab dip with pita is incredible. You definitely won't be disappointed. For 1/2 an order of nachos, you'd be surprised at how big they are!

I've been here for lunch and gotten the chicken and rice (it's OK, definitely not as good as the NYC food-truck version it tries to impersonate),the fish tacos (awesome choice), and also for dinner with some kind of chicken dinner.

Its hard to argue that you can exit the Cheesecake Factory without a full belly and a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, that comes at the cost of some of the most high calorie entrees imaginable.

The place does a decent job of managing the huge demand put on it by the throngs of mall-goers hungry for some Wisconsin-sized plates. And to be fair, they do have a full ""skinnylicious"" menu to encourage, or at least offer, more healthy menu options. But at the end of the day, their menu seems to rely a bit to heavily on butter and oil as the primary constituents of flavor.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

Beverages are pretty pricey but for $8.50 ($5 more than the regular fountain drink) you can get a fountain drink in a cool souvenir glass to take home that would cost you $7.50 by itself in their store.

I've watched Gordon Ramsay's YouTube video on how to make Beef Wellington several times because it is such an amazing dish and work of art! I've never tasted it or attempted to make it, so coming here was a dream came true. 

We ordered the dinner special to share: Caesar salad, Beef Wellington, bread pudding for dessert with a side of Mac n cheese. Everything was fantastic. We were so full we took most of the Mac n cheese home. 

If I were to describe Beef Wellington to someone else who has never tasted it I'd say it's the most tender meat you've ever had. It seams to me that the flakey shell around the meat steams it while it cooks so it no longer tastes like a steak, but more like a roast. It's very delicious, just not what I expected.

Now that I know what Beef Wellington tastes like from the master himself, I can attempt a homemade version for the holidays with his YouTube guidance!","Business review: 5.0 Stars

People are using parking for airport bullshit. They cost share with the valet so no need to tip I guess at that cost. Disgusting with all the bad press this place has. The Venetian doesn't charge for Valet. They are so greedy at Mandalay Bay. It's the MGM corporation in general. All their hotels are doing this.

Found out that if you park at the shopping center valet at Mandalay it's free. Sounds silly to rant about this. The casinos just rip everything off. So flood the mall parking.","Business review: 1.0 Stars

Went to try the veal sandwich and check out their baked goods. 
Veal sandwich - 2.5 stars. The veal wasn't tender enough which made it difficult to bite through. I added provolone and onions which was decent, but the onions were sliced pretty big. The tomato sauce was liquidy which makes me think there isn't enough tomato paste. This made the sandwich more soggy than tasty. 
Baked goods - 2 stars. I can't comment on the taste since i just checked it out but a handful of the items looked familiar from other bakeries which makes me think that they don't bake onsite. Also there was a lot of condensation build up in one of the cake/cookie fridge which make the food look unappetizing. The only things that looked worth trying was the lemon meringue and the cannolis.
Final thoughts - was hoping for way better but got less than mediocre. Won't be trying out again.","Business review: 2.0 Stars

The veggies were soggy, the lobster was rubbery. My son, who eats anything you put in front of him, took one bite of his grilled cheese and refused to touch it again. Then we go up front to pay, it takes another 7 mins for someone to come ring us up. She asks how it was and we told her it was awful, she said ""sorry, $34.24"" we should've just walked out, I wouldn't have felt guilty, it was disgusting.","Business review: 1.0 Stars

So they actually stole 30.00 from us.  No way to prove it, but be careful if you use a gift card. I will be letting all of my friends know about this!","Business review: 1.0 Stars

the menu was a little confusing because it was in Italian I think but the waiter was happy to help
I got the seafood linguine as recommended as the waiter as a popular dish 
The food took quite a while to arrive but we did get free bread with olive oil but it was quite hard and dry so I did not really like it and didn't eat it
when we got the food we were quite disappointed by the portion as it was expensive for the small portion we got. we easily demolished  the noodles in 5  min and felt hungry even after spending around $25. the noodles themselves were very tasty and flavourful and they add cheese at the top but definitely not worth the price so only come if you're willing to splurge or have a small stomach
overall I would not come again due to the high price tag and the small portions","Business review: 3.0 Stars

Good food and great customer service. The manager Thomas is awesome and so friendly. He recognizes my fiancé and I as frequent customers and always greets us and asks us about our day.

I switch off from a burrito and bowl. With my burrito I ask them to mix it up and it's so delicious! I also get half chicken half steak so I get the best of both worlds for 1 price.

We asked for chips and salsa she said they only have nachos.  We ordered quesadilla, asked for sour cream and salsa which she brought for us.  So....hmmmm, I guessed they have chips (nachos?) and obviously have salsa - so we asked her and her response was ""it's not on the menu"".  I suggested that next time she should go into the kitchen and ask them to throw chips in a bowl and salsa in a bowl and bring it out, she told me I was being confrontational.  I told her I am in the public service industry and I was just trying to help her out, she rolled her eyes.

She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat. 

We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.

Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)","Business review: 1.0 Stars
