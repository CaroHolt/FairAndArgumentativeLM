Do not let them do this.  A person listed as ""payable on death"" has ZERO interest in your account while you are still alive.

Let them know you'll get a lawyer if they don't change their tune -- and that it'll cost them a LOT more than $800.  Bank stealing money from innocent children?

I generally oppose laws that make actions illegal just because they might, in combination with other actions, have the potential to cause harm. I believe in punishing those who cause the harm, and not limiting action based purely on speculation.

That being said, the voting process has become an emotional one. People -- whether voters or legislators -- pass laws based on their gut reactions, often without any concern for the consequences or long term effects. Logic and reason have largely been abandoned in favor of making headlines.

This is what I can think of:

Retributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social ""harmony"" or ""balance.""  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.

The rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.",How can the rationale for punishment specifically retribution seen as social cohesion?.?

Anyway, conservatives are for the protection of a traditional way of life, of the status quo, of stability. Conservatives are therefore against any social upheaval or change. Conservatives feel that too much change is dangerous, destabilizing, and ultimately the death of a society, and that a strong government is needed to protect the people, even if it means restricting freedom somewhat.

Moderates see the value in both. They agree that change is necessary and that freedom is important and that both can be beneficial, but that full-blown anarchy is not desirable and that the government can actually help the protection of freedom.","Since liberalism=liberty and a liberal must be for freedom,what does a conservative or moderate person equal?"

But the rational and prevailing part of me opposes the death penalty because of the risk of innocent people being killed. People think DNA is the killsafe...it is not..not all cases involve DNA and those convicted before the use of DNA often cannot get appeals to have the test performed. So oppose it, lest I or someone I know faces the fate of the unknown amount of innocents sentenced to death.","Regardless of whether a person deserves the death penalty, is the death penalty right?"

Historically, when human rights were being defined women were not included.

For example: The US Constitution was written to protect and preserve the rights of citizens of the newly-formed United States. Women, however, were not believed to have all of the rights enshrined in that document and had to struggle to have their rights as citizens recognized.
.
Although any discussion of human rights includes women by definition, the overall umbrella of ""human rights"" is not always seen as addressing issues specific to the female gender. These issues include child-bearing, sexual abuse and oppressive cultural traditions/laws which prevent women from enjoying the ""human rights"" that men have.

In a nutshell, when someone says ""women's rights"" they are  talking about human rights that women do not have yet---or they are discussing something gender-specific.

Firstly, it is the people of Singapore - not outsiders - who should make that decision.

Secondly, low crime rates in Singapore are directly attributable to their non-tolerance of those who seek to undermine society.  Singapore is a society which tolerates all cultures and religions and welcomes their diversity - but it will not pander to a minority who seek to destroy the society they have created.

However, the death penalty in itself is not the reason for the high quality of life in Singapore.  It is merely one component of a society which believes that protecting the innocent is more important than protecting the guilty.

Incidentally, the previous writer's argument that the death penalty is 'more expensive' than life in prison is only true in the USA, which has an incredibly complex appeals process that leads to legal manouvering rather than true justice.",The death penalty should be abolished in Singapore.

I'm not sure I agree with the premise of your question.  Racial profiling consisted of a systematic suspicion of particular minorities as inherently criminal.  If insurance companies were to charge all, say, black customers more than white customers on the suspicion that black drivers get in more accidents, I'm quite sure they would be subject to suit.

But, in any event, law enforcement personnel carry and use guns and handcuffs, send people to jails and prisons, have the capacity to ruin the lives of innocent people who happen to be of a particular minority.  Insurance companies... sell insurance, which you can get from hundreds of competitor companies.  Discrimination in law enforcement just matters a whole heck of a lot more than discrimination by insurers.

SCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. - Two men who were arrested for walking through a Wal-Mart while wearing women's thong underwear blamed the stunt on a ""triple-dog dare,"" authorities said. 

The men, ages 35 and 36, bought two pair of underwear at the store Tuesday, went into a bathroom and came out wearing only the thongs and T-shirts, police said. 

Witnesses said the men walked through the store and out to their car. 

Police caught the men in the parking lot, and reviewed a surveillance tape before arresting them for public indecency and disorderly conduct. 

When asked why they were wearing thong underwear, one of the men said a friend ""triple-dog dared"" them. They will not be prosecuted, authorities said.",How legally binding is a triple dog dare?

Companies can advertise that their products are better than their competitors' products. They are even encouraged to use images of their competitors' products in their ads. This encourages competition and as long as they aren't intentionally trying to confuse people, fair use protects such use of trademarks and copyrights.

By the way, there is no such thing as truth in advertisement so no evidence is required to make such claims.

Edit: The legal departments of most companies won't let them make libelous ads. There's a difference between saying ""Product A is better than product B"" and ""Company A is better than company B because they kill young children and then eat them"".",Why cannot a company advertise their product as better than another competitor's product as better than theirs

The press sells papers by exaggerating the issues. Guantanamo was an excellent example.  While the inmates were humiliated, they weren't tortured.  The accusations still spring up, however, and the UN is using the accusation to bash the US.

Additionally, the UN has determined that force feeding prisoners that go on a hunger strike is torture.  So, if you feed them, it's torture.  If you don't and they starve, it's torture.

Finally, prisoners will lie about treatment because it's a form of political power they can use while incarcerated.",Is torture ever justified? Why or why not?
