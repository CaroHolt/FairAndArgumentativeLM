Financial Stability - There's many high paying professions that are only accessible to attractive women, and even without that they can expect to be paid more doing service or reception type roles. They also have more capacity to demand a relationship where they provide less financially.

Wealth of Opportunity - Attractive women are more likely to find a champion for their cause, or someone willing to give them a chance. That's what charm gets you.

Basically, it seems like netflix should be paying for more of the bandwidth it uses, especially when it is taking so many viewers away from the big cable companies. If we continue to see the trend of internet usage increase, the consumer is going to be charged anyway, either by Netflix or Comcast/Verizon, because the infrastructure needs to be improved. I can also see more localized service providers, since they will be getting a cut from large bandwidth users such as YouTube and Netflix. I can also see this leading to an unpackaging of channels, since an improved infrastructure will allow consumers access only channels they want straight from the internet.

Without going into too many SPOILERS the gist of it for this discussion involves how when confronted by the prospect of pirates the best the crew could do was to alert the maritime security command, deploy water hoses, and try to swamp the oncoming skiffs. However, once the pirates boarded, the crew of a dozen plus men became helpless against four armed pirates with AK47s. Only, the wit and wisdom of Captain Phillips and his crew kept them alive, although Phillips was himself taken hostage.

If the crew had armed security or at least had guns stored on the ship in case of emergencies like this, the incident would probably never have happened.","The movie ""Captain Philips"" presents a strong argument for gun rights. CMV"

It is okay to lie if a sketchy person knocks on your door and asks if your parents are home (let us say you are 10 years old) and you say yes, even though they are not.

Particular situations, that are protecting feelings or life-threatening situations, are okay to lie because it for the greater good of protecting life or emotions. The lie itself does not do any harm by protecting people. 

Please change my view and prove to me that lying is NEVER okay.

That is actually how infinity is defined: equivalent to the size of the set of integers. On the other hand, for every pair of reals, there is another real in-between the pair, so the set of reals is uncountably infinite (the cardinality of the set is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of integers).

I don't know how to really feel about what the NSA is doing, but I do think that Snowden was, at least to an extent, a traitor. Not because of his whistleblowing, but his escape from the United States and into a country that had worse policies than the policies he seemingly exposed.

It seems like a pretty common viewpoint on Reddit at least that people like Hitler, for example, were disgusting things that had no value on this Earth. It's also a common viewpoint that people like MLK Jr. were great people whose death should be mourned. We essentially assign postmortem value to people. This is where my problem lies. Why should one person be mourned while another is spit on when they were created equal?

We mourn the loss of friends and family everyday, but still cheer at the death of others like Bin Laden.

While I by no means defend the actions of people such as Hitler and Bin Laden, the loss of a human life should not be thought of as an accomplishment.

I think no human life is worth less than that of another for what they did during their lives, and we as a society should not act grateful for some people who have died while mourning others.

By blurring the line, I am referring to initiatives and movements to allow chiropractors to prescribe medicine.  What the hell is that about?  This happened recently in New Mexico.

Chiropractors fight tooth and nail for legitimacy and recognition (e.g. by demanding/needing to be called ""doctor"" even in a non-professional environment).  Through abuse of the legal system and the governmental bureaucracy, we have allowed these dangerous quacks to insert themselves into life-and-death medical issues. AND, it is not harmless tomfoolery either, because neck manipulations cause 100s if not 1000s of strokes every year.

EDIT: to be less combative.",CMV: Chiropractors are intentionally blurring the lines between mainstream medicine and alternative medicine.

* By starting school later, you are ending school later because schools require a certain amount of time every day. Instead of starting from 7:30 to 2:00 school runs from 8:30 to 3:00.

* If you're getting out later then you're staying up later doing homework to the point that there is no difference in the amount of hours slept.

Yes, when we think of homophobia we might imagine people who have a hatred and/or fear of gays, and pursue that by violent means. Lots of people accept gays but don't accept gay marriage. That's fine with me, everyone is entitled to absolute freedom of conscience in my opinion. But they are still denying homosexuals equal rights, and are therefore homophobes.

When it came time to vaccinate me, my parents declined because of how fragile I was at the time.

Surely a pedophile who has no inclination or possibility of molesting or abusing a child is just as functional in society as a homosexual, if not a heterosexual?

However, it is also true that if an employee does not make minimum wage after tips, it is the responsibility of the employer to cover the difference. Theoretically, if all tips stopped at once, then employers would be forced to pay minimum wage to all employees, which would eventually have to lead to a change in wage structure in the service industry. Moreover, in my opinion tipping, due to its cash-y nature, allows for shady accounting and tax evasion and in the end benefits employers more than employees.

I'm sure there'll be a counter argument saying that minimum wage is not a living wage and that tips allow service industry people to survive.

Countries breach trade treaties all the time, and while there are certainly consequences in the form of damaged relationships, sanctions and the like, there is no irresistible penalty or punishment that can be given.

I'd rather live on the equator as compared to antartica.

A warmer earth will be caused by the trapping of heat which means that antartica should heat up faster than the equator as heat flows from the center of the earth and less goes into space.

So even if some land is overtaken by rising sea levels more land should be livable.

The way they argued it is that racism is no longer racism if it's directed at the racial group in power aka white people. This is a paradox. They are discriminating against a specific race to redefine the term, 'racism', manifesting the new term, 'reverse racism', to address racial discrimination against white people.

The ultimate ""good"" is when you act to the benefit of others (and yourself, if possible) without causing any damage to others (or yourself, if possible) in the long-term sense.
The problem is that it is difficult to determine a metric due to the way how benefits and damage are sometimes relative. Often times, the effects are sometimes not even seen until years (even centuries) after the cause.

In my personal experience, there is zero accountability for one's actions.  Instead, addicts are taught to say something along the lines of, ""I am sorry that my addiction has caused X problem.""  Where the proper line should be, ""I am sorry that 'I' did X.""",I find addicts weak and unwilling to take responsibility for their own actions. CMV
